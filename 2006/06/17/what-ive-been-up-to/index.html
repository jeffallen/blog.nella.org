Things didn’t work perfectly, but we showed, in addition to the technical capabilities we were demonstrating, that we can overcome problems and make the show go on. The biggest challenge for Humaninet right now is finding a Jeff replacement; I did all of my work for them knowing I’d be leaving, so it’s all documented.

I’d like to think I was a benevolent dictator, but I do remember dropping the axe on at least one guy during the day: I pointedly rearranged his priorities when I found him arranging marketing materials for a technical demonstration which he hadn’t proved worked yet. I told him, “go make it work, then we’ll talk about how you will show it off”. Sigh.\nI’d sent my mom a flyer that MSF-USA made which is called, “I never leave without packing…” which is returned American volunteers talking about what stuff they take with them. It was factually very useful to me, and my mom found it very comforting to see that real people go off on (and come back from) MSF missions and have enough fun to write about it in a fun personal way when they get back. I gave her a 1 pound (500 gram) budget in my bag for her to send stuff. When I arrived she had a huge basket full of about 5 pounds of stuff, but actually it wasn’t that much when we edited out duplicate things (she wasn’t sure on what type I wanted) and took things out of packages.\nI went on a shopping spree today to get some more stuff I wanted. I’ve been taking Jon’s advice pretty literally, since I can tell he and I think about things the same way. He’d sold me on a North Face duffel bag he uses as a suitcase, but I’d talked myself out of it, opting instead for my Gregory backpack which I’ve used on several trips and which I know intimately. Jon also gave me some useful pointers on pants (cotton + equator = mildew). Well, as it happens the pants I ended up wanting were at North Face, so I got to go see Jon’s duffel bag up close and I instantly fell in love.
