I realized we’d already showed interopability when we’d taken laptops from first responders from all over the nation and let them connect over VPNs back to their home office and do email with each other. I pointed this out in my talk, and said, “IP stands for internet protocol, but it might as well stand for Interoperability Protocol”. That quote got picked up by the next speaker down the table, and it clearly resonated with the crowd.\nAnother thing that was really meaningful to me was when Sheriff Kevin Beary of Orange County Police Department spoke up. He told me that the work my team had done was the kind of hands on problem solving and lesson learning that we needed and that he was proud of the initiative it showed. I don’t remember his words exactly, but the undercurrent was, “people like you make the difference, not expensive systems from the sales guys”.\nIn response to a pointed question by a fire chief about “when will your system and motorola’s system work together”, a vendor danced around it and gave an unconvincing argument (I think it was MA/Com). I decided to open a can of whopass on the vendors and spoke up. I said, “Look, you don’t have to wait for moto or ma/com to deliver interoperability to you. You need to find an independent consultant, get their help to choose commodity parts that use IP, and build your network just like we built ours. You can have interoperability today. Stop waiting for the vendors to solve your problems, and show them that the marketplace is only buying open systems.”\nAnother cool thing is that Commissioner Deborah Tate was there for much of the discussion. She gave a little speech when she had to leave, listing lessons she’d heard that she was going to take back to DC. There were 10 or 15, but two I’d mentioned made the cut: education for emergency responders on the benefits of unlicensed spectrum and IP = interoperability. (She didn’t use my quote, but she clearly got the idea, because it had been hit by so many people, including me.)\nSo, it was a trip well worth making!\n",
