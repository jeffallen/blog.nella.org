Heh. I have proof that people don&rsquo;t read the code they are installing.
Since the earliest widely-distributed releases of Cricket, there&rsquo;s been an easter egg in it. It is hidden in code that should arouse the curiosity of anyone doing a security audit, but it is hidden well enough that someone poking around in the code won&rsquo;t see it. To my knowledge the only person who&rsquo;s ever found it was Javier Muniz, my officemate when I was writing Cricket. And that was only after I dropped a hint that I&rsquo;d put an easter egg into Cricket. Javier&rsquo;s a bright guy, and it didn&rsquo;t take him long to find it.">

<p>Since the earliest widely-distributed releases of <a href="http://cricket.sf.net">Cricket</a>, there&rsquo;s been an easter egg in it. It is hidden in code that should arouse the curiosity of anyone doing a security audit, but it is hidden well enough that someone poking around in the code won&rsquo;t see it.
