      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m learning Clojure, which is a modern Lisp, which is hosted on the JVM. I&amp;rsquo;m so far really liking the focus on integrating the benefits of functional programming into a modern environment. It is pragmatic and reasonable. It feels like programming for grown-ups, in the same way that Node.js feels like programming for people with more energy than sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While riding on the train with my kids, I told them, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m learning this new language, let&amp;rsquo;s use it to make a card game since we don&amp;rsquo;t have any cards with us.&amp;rdquo; Clojure, as a Lisp, is meant to be usable interactively from a REPL and since I was on my phone in a train, I used an in-browser version of Clojure called ClojureScript. The one I used is at &lt;a href=&#34;http://trycojure.org&#34;&gt;http://trycojure.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
