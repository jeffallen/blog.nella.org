      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a great first Sugru experience! I scratched my finger on the way to work on my unicycle. I thought, dammit, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna fix that! So I bought some from my phone on the train. Cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, it arrived in the post. I was having a hard time explaining why I was so excited about it to my wife. So I sat down, cut open my first packet and started fixing. My wife got interested, fast! She asked, would this stick to the door handle to make a bumper? I said, go try! And off she ran with my Sugru, leaving me grinning and cutting open a new packet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Just Married</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from the web for a while because I was in Olivone, Ticino, Switzerland getting married!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to friends and family who came from so far away to witness such a special day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks also to our wonderful vendors, who made the day go so well. If you are thinking of putting on a wedding in Blenio, give these guys a call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albergo-arcobaleno.ch/&#34;&gt;Restaurant/Hotel Arcobaleno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.casalucomagno.ch/&#34;&gt;Casa Lucomagno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.swissguide.ch/it/Forno/Olivone/1141813_panetteriaepasticceriabi.html&#34;&gt;Pasticceria Bini&lt;/a&gt; for wedding cakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://designyou.ch&#34;&gt;Viva gli sposi&lt;/a&gt; wedding photojournalism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/giramondo&#34;&gt;Giramondo Travel Agency&lt;/a&gt; for the wedding registry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mx3.ch/artist/sonpalaria&#34;&gt;Sonpalaria&lt;/a&gt;, the heartbeat of the Ticinese dance floor!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels different to be married. It seems like it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; the house is the same, we still sleep on the same sides of the bed. But it&amp;rsquo;s different. Good. And safe. And happy. And&amp;hellip; different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Heard in Europe</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2009/04/20/heard-in-europe/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.nella.org/?p=643</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overheard here in England (which was, last I checked, a European country):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a really interesting partnership we could join, but we&amp;rsquo;d have to make friends with a bunch of Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert sound of my jaw dropping the floor here&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some pointers to things I&#39;ve recently liked</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2009/03/25/some-pointers-to-things-ive-recently-liked/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 02:58:18 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.nella.org/?p=596</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a random smattering of links to things that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently checked out, and that I really like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Men&#34;&gt;Children of Men&lt;/a&gt;: A well made film about an interesting story in dystopic England (though, to be perfectly honest, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard to tell the difference between that England and the one outside my window). I had the &amp;ldquo;last generation&amp;rdquo; story idea last weekend. I sent it to &lt;a href=&#34;http://512words.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Curtis&lt;/a&gt;, and he told me about Children of Men. I made the link go to the Wikipedia page and not the IMDB page, as is customary. The Wikipedia article on the movie is really nice, with great director&amp;rsquo;s commentary, as well as other goodies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jungledisk.com&#34;&gt;Jungle Disk&lt;/a&gt;: Best solution to off-site backups. You pay USD 20 one time for a nice piece of software, and you have perpetual rights to use it on as many computers as you want (Mac, PC, Linux). It helps you put data into &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon S3 account. You pay your bills to Amazon. You own your data, Amazon makes sure you don&amp;rsquo;t lose it (Jungle Disk has published their schema, so even if you decided to throw away their program or they go out of business, your data is still available to you). Key points: Amazon S3 is cheaper than any possible backup medium you could choose in your own house (include amortized hardware costs, energy costs, and the hassle factor &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t cheat on the hardware, you have to have reliability as high as S3, which means both your hardware cost and your hassle factor will be much higher than you think it is), because you have a direct relationship with Amazon, there&amp;rsquo;s no markup on storage or bandwidth. The price of your backups can only go down relative to the on-line offsite backup market as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://onlive.com/&#34;&gt;Onlive&lt;/a&gt;: Karl, Cary, and Arnold are finally out of stealth mode! Yay! It seems like &amp;ldquo;Xbox over vnc&amp;rdquo; to me, but what do I know. I never really mastered minesweeper. Just give me a good book&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_of_the_Wind&#34;&gt;The Shadow of the Wind&lt;/a&gt;: A good book. Multiple layers, several stories running at once, from different times, coming at you at once, all set in beautiful and atmospheris Barcelona. Good stuff.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The power of debt</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2009/01/22/the-power-of-debt/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2009 02:33:38 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.nella.org/?p=518</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote that turns everything you think you know on it&amp;rsquo;s head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the debt is big enough, it&amp;rsquo;s the debtor who has the power, not the creditor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vanityfair.com/online/politics/2009/01/niall-ferguson-america-needs-to-cancel-its-debt.html&#34;&gt;Niall Ferguson talking in Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s for stuff like that I read Vanity Fair. Well, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/02/cate-blanchett-slideshow200902?slide=18&#34;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t hurt either&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>512 words</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to Curtis&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://512words.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;512 words&lt;/a&gt;. If he sucks and doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it often enough, I&amp;rsquo;ll do them myself here on this site and embarrass him. How&amp;rsquo;s that for a helpful, encouraging friend? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curtis&amp;rsquo; adventure to take the time to be a professional writer is really inspiring, and it is part of what brought me back to my blogging. I am also considering to do some recreational fiction writing. Perhaps 512 of Curtis&amp;rsquo; words will inspire me even more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After an extended downtime due to lack of give-a-shit on my part, my blog is back, and I am back to blogging. Expect something here daily, which is my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots and lots of news&amp;hellip; where to start? I suppose at the last post. Since then, Marina and I were evacuated from Chad due to fighting in the town where our project was located. We then found a nice little meningitis emergency in DR Congo. When we came home we had a little vacation, then I went to the USA to see family after close to a year away. We found separate postings with MSF for the summer, which was hard but worthwhile. Marina worked in Myanmar doing mobile clinics from boats, and I went to Oromyia, Ethiopia to participate in an nutritional emergency intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This came from a heretical Lutheran friend of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vatican-airline-takes-to-the-skies&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070827/wl_nm/vatican_travel_dc&#34;&gt;Vatican airline takes to the skies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the Ryanair quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ryanair already performs miracles that even the Pope&amp;rsquo;s boss can&amp;rsquo;t
rival, by delivering pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela for the
heavenly price of 10 euros,&amp;rdquo; Ryanair said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the Swiss Guard perform TSA or Air Marshal duties? Will they get
to carry their halberds?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some serious wandering on Google Video lead me, by way of the brilliant Bravia commercials, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myla.com/uk/pleasure-like-no-other/&#34;&gt;this fun remix&lt;/a&gt; for what seems like a nice product line. And that in turn lead me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myspace.com/bevleeharling&#34;&gt;Bev Lee Harling&amp;rsquo;s music&lt;/a&gt;, which is another pleasurable discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I realize that somehow I am 2 years late, but I just discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oneringzero.com&#34;&gt;One Ring Zero&lt;/a&gt;, and I am also in love with them as of right this minute. So there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in addition to getting her shots, Kat got microchipped. I&amp;rsquo;m a little jealous; I figured my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whitehouse.gov&#34;&gt;criminally invasive government&lt;/a&gt; or one of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://microsoft.com&#34;&gt;evil employers&lt;/a&gt; would have chipped me before a pet I owned got it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in case you care (or happen to be searching the Internet for Kat&amp;rsquo;s number because you&amp;rsquo;ve found her), Kat&amp;rsquo;s number is 467B7B4F03.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I made a video out of the random video clips I&amp;rsquo;d gathered with my and other people&amp;rsquo;s digital cameras. Instead of emailing the 45 megabyte movie to y&amp;rsquo;all (Bad Idea), I put the video on Google Video (Good Idea). The other nice thing is that instead of being in the stupid Windows-only movie format that Windows Movie Maker gave me (Bad Idea), Google translates it into a format that virtually any web browser can use (Good Idea).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just arrived in Roseburg for a few days with family. We just drove down from Seattle, where the whole family was present for the first day of my newphew&amp;rsquo;s life on earth. Pretty neat seeing a baby less than one day old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am being cute with him. His name is Keiden William Bagley. He was 20 inches long and weighed 7 pounds 3 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;baby&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://www.nella.org/jra/images/jra-keiden.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun watching all the adults turn in blubbering idiots while holding Keiden. I was, of course, not immune to his effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple pictures of Kat, the dog I brought home from Mobile, AL. Her full name is Katrina, but she goes by Kat. She&amp;rsquo;s perhaps 10 weeks old now, meaning that she was born about the time of Hurricane Katrina. She was abandoned in a hotel room in Mobile. I encountered her while taking a rather random walk in Mobile with Angela. I decided she&amp;rsquo;d be good company on the drive to Oregon. (She = the dog, but as it turns out, Angela made good company too!) In Oregon, I expected to find her a home by writing an article for the hometown paper. On the drive across, I fell in love with Kat, so she&amp;rsquo;s found a home a little closer to home than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a couple paragraphs as a homework assignment, and I thought it would be fun to post them here, to look back on when I am more fully literate. I have applied all the corrections my teacher made to the essay here. They were mostly small changes, but at least one sentence needed to have it grammar all sorted out by her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mi padre en San AndrÃ©s y mi abuelo tienen elgo en comÃºn. Ambos hombres trabajaron como operator de sierra en una fÃ¡brica de madera. En inglÃ©s, le llamamos &amp;ldquo;a sawer&amp;rdquo;. Â¿Le llamamos en espaÃ±ol un serrador?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Austin Powers is on TV. I totally forgot about the hilarious monolouge by Dr. Evil about his family background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Evil:&lt;/strong&gt; The details of my life are quite inconsequential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapist (Carrie Fisher):&lt;/strong&gt; Oh no, please, please, let&amp;rsquo;s hear about your childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Evil:&lt;/strong&gt; Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we&amp;rsquo;d make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian woman named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it&amp;rsquo;s breathtaking, I suggest you try it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten it was St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s day until I checked my personal email and discovered mail from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tempestmusic.com/html/michael.html&#34;&gt;Michael Mullen&lt;/a&gt; giving last-minute notice of a Tempest show in the City. Karl and I headed up around 7 pm on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate at &lt;a href=&#34;http://chachacha.citysearch.com/&#34;&gt;Cha Cha Cha&lt;/a&gt;, which was interesting fare for an Irish holiday (things got stranger later when the Swedish lead singer of an Irish band started playing Swedish folk songs). We went down the street to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.12galaxies.com/&#34;&gt;12 Galaxies&lt;/a&gt; to hear &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tempestmusic.com&#34;&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;McDonalds is running a giveaway billed as a &amp;ldquo;thank you to our customers&amp;rdquo;. If you read the fine print in the advertisement, it turns out this giveaway is a settlement to a lawsuit. Here&amp;rsquo;s the allegation made in the complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs and Class Members, were deprived of the chance to win certain prizes offered as part of McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Promotional Games, as advertised and promoted by Defendants. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the promotional games were a sham because Jerome Jacobson, an employee of Simon Marketing, Inc., the company retained by McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation to administer the promotional games, and others unrelated to defendants Simon Marketing, Inc. or McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Corporation, rigged the games by misappropriating many of the winning game prizes totaling at least $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Georgia is considering an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/03/04/online.lottery.ap/index.html&#34;&gt;e-Lottery&lt;/a&gt; because, according to the sponsor, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re trying to target a market that may not be part of the lottery now &amp;ndash; techies or professional people tied to computers all day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been taught that lotteries are a tax on people who don&amp;rsquo;t understand probabilities. Perhaps the reason professional people don&amp;rsquo;t play the lottery is that they understand it is not a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I came up with a vegetarian food that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, and probably should not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetarian procuitto could be simulated with heavily processed and colored shitake mushrooms. It would be called &amp;ldquo;pro-shit-o&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocities.com/wavs03/rimshot.wav&#34;&gt;rimshot&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Turns out plants are &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0105910/2004/01/22.html#a713&#34;&gt;thinking too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s only one non-sentient food product left on the planet: Right-wing Republican Ribs! Finger lickin&amp;rsquo; good. (And if you happen to get Rush&amp;rsquo;s ribs, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a nice buzz from the residual oxycontin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, this is neat stuff. It is further proof that cellular automata are a critical part of the working of the world. Far from being simply a mathematical curiousity, they appear to be the mechanism by which complex behavior emerges from simple systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What effect will it have on the economies of the world when the economies of virtual worlds are harmonized and integrated into the real economies? One of the central ideas of the Western, market based economy is that infinite growth (or at least, growth for the forseeable future) is possible. I&amp;rsquo;ve always considered that idea suspicious. Perhaps these virtual spaces will give the real economy more room to grow. At least the virtual economies do not yet seem to have the same old externalities (pollution, class divides, mono-culture, etc). What externalities do these economies have that we just haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed yet?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Karl&amp;rsquo;s been doing the crossword online at Yahoo for a while now. I worked one at lunch the other day with him, and found it really enjoyable. This was a really easy one, suitable for a newbie like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid I used to watch my grandparents working together on the crossword. I liked watching them do them, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any clues, so I disliked the crossword itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I had a little get together for my closest friends for cocktails, cards, birthday cake, and good conversation. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally like card games too much, but under the right circumstances, they are a blast. The circumstances tonight was studying up for next weekend when I might need to know the details of some card games. As usual, of course, the studying will prove completely useless. So, not a blast, but worthwhile anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Going through the transitions where your parents go from &amp;ldquo;the people who&amp;rsquo;s job it is to form you&amp;rdquo;, to &amp;ldquo;fellow adults living in this world with you&amp;rdquo; is tricky. Not everyone goes through it, but my parents and I did, a few years into college. Happily, it went so well that we even progressed to being friends, which I suppose some people never do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents came to visit California this weekend. They are homeless right now, because they&amp;rsquo;ve sold their house, but their new one is not ready to move in to yet. So they came to the cabin, and then down to Redwood City to see my house. We had a good time at the cabin, doing the normal 50% work, 50% play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I passed my BCC certification, which means that I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to charter boats up to 25 feet from anywhere in the Bay Area (and around the world, too). On Thursday, I went out on my first solo trip. Our crew worked together well, and we had a good mix of just relaxing sailing, splashing through waves, and practicing. The only problem is that the ladies didn&amp;rsquo;t get as much time on the tiller as they probably deserved. But it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to make it fair when people steadfastly claim they are &amp;ldquo;fine&amp;rdquo; and don&amp;rsquo;t want to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this wide range of viewpoints is why we can never make any progress in American politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first set was &lt;a href=&#34;http://art.net/~4ss/&#34;&gt;Four Shillings Short&lt;/a&gt;, second set: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.broceliande.org/&#34;&gt;Broceliande&lt;/a&gt;, third set: all 6 of them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue was great, the bands were fun, the sound mix was awesome (that&amp;rsquo;s a big deal when the music itself is intrinsically acoustic), and the people I went with were fun. I even got up and danced a waltz at the end, and the band seemed to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, it is official, I am signed on to the trip to sail for 9 days off the coast of Croatia! Wow, this is going to be amazing! &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dreamsailing.it/english/fleet/priv465_nikawa2.htm&#34;&gt;The sailboat&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ll be chartering is really swanky! We will be picking it up in Split, Croatia. From there we&amp;rsquo;ll probably be heading south in to the archipelago off the coast there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really need to read up in my Lonely Planet to learn more about that area before I get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took my first real sailing lesson today. It didn&amp;rsquo;t really cover much more than previous lessons, but getting more practice is always welcome. Also, you can learn the same thing a different way from two teachers, then integrate the best of both. Today&amp;rsquo;s teacher dislikes judging the wind direction using the weathervanes on the top of the mast, and instead taught us how to judge the wind direction by looking at the ripples on top of the waves. That&amp;rsquo;s a useful skill!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.meetup.com&#34;&gt;blog.meetup.com&lt;/a&gt; meetup for San Jose tonight. I met a cool group of people there. Conversation was good enough I forgot to leave and go get dinner, so tonight I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to subsist on a cookie and a mocha. Geek food!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I went to one other meetup, which was only so-so. It seems that bloggers are naturally a bit, uh, different socially, and that feeds into a successful meetup. Like the blogosphere itself, any lull was immediately filled with an interesting tidbit, keeping the conversation going. And then the brainstorming on any given topic ran to unpredictably strange ends. Somehow we manged to invent outsourced bus driving and coffee drinks with bacon bits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So after I finished my chores (restack the woodpile, clean the gutters, sweep the roof, replace the disposer), I went down to check it out. It has been so long since I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a county fair. It was fun. I called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeuscat.com/&#34;&gt;Andrew and Holly&lt;/a&gt; and alerted them to join me. They had a good time too, and Holly says she got lots of up-close pictures of people just being people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m driving up to Roseburg today for Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day weekend and my mom&amp;rsquo;s retirement party. It&amp;rsquo;s a long drive, but going home for a visit is always worth the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I surprised mom for Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day a few years ago. That was really fun. This time she knows I&amp;rsquo;m coming, but it should be just as fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be one of the last times I visit the house on Glenmar. Mom and Dick are downsizing into a smaller house, and a smaller mortgage for their retirement. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite how they had planned things, but the down stock market and economy is hitting everyone just a little.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Guess what type of &amp;ldquo;nutritional packet&amp;rdquo; comes in these varieties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet-fig, Pisang Mas, Amas Date, Bocadillo, Ney Poovan Ney Poovan, Safet Velchi, Cavendish Dwarf Cavendish, Giant Cavendish, Lacatan, Poyo (Robusta), Williams, Americani, Valery, Arvis, Gros Michel, Highgate, Pink Fig, Green pink Fig, Ibota, Apple Fig, Silk, Pacovan, Prata Ana, Mysore Mysore, Pisang Ceylan, Gorolo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some things I&#39;m thinking about doing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have broad curiousity, which I&amp;rsquo;ve made the best of, given that it tends to limit my ability to focus on something for long periods of time. I&amp;rsquo;m currently, though not permanently, at peace with the fact that I tend to progress just past &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo; in all that I do, then lose interest in making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way I keep this from being a total character flaw is that I do keep committments, like running a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snout.org/Game&#34;&gt;Game&lt;/a&gt;, or being in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://geocities.com/connectingthroughdance/&#34;&gt;dance performance&lt;/a&gt;. So while you may not be able to count on me to stick with something new more than 6 or 9 months, you can count on me to stick with those things for which I sign up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Magazines</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I only subscribe to one magazine at a time right now, because otherwise my curiousity would bury me under a pile of magazines every month. I try different ones from year to year, just to see what all is out there. I&amp;rsquo;m currently subscribed to Atlantic Monthly, as a result of William Langewiesche&amp;rsquo;s interview on Fresh Air. I also had read a few Atlantic Monthly articles on-line and that was so tedious that I gave up and bought the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Go fly a kite!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rule number 1 of &amp;ldquo;How to be Jeff&amp;rdquo; is &amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060811100537/http://usscouts.org/usscouts/advance/boyscout/bsmotto.html&#34;&gt;Always have a kite in your car, just in case.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up from my computer at about 5:30 pm and noticed that the impending storm was bringing with it gusty winds and interesting clouds. I decided it was high time to get back out to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080504034842/http://www.gwtw-kites.com/Shorelineparkmt.viewca.info.asp&#34;&gt;Shoreline Park Kite Flying Area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to watch a nice sunset, and fly my kite backwards! The prevailing winds at the kite flying area usually are on-shore from the Bay. Today they were coming from the mountains. I also discovered an interesting new form of recreation. It combines kite flying (for relaxation) with wind sprints (for exercise). See when you are flying a stunt kite alone, every time you crash the kite you have to go to the kite, reassemble it (ok, only after really big crashes!), and set it up for another launch. I was in a hurry to get as many flights as I could before I ran out of light, so I sprinted up and back to the kite after every crash. It also had the nice effect of keeping me warm, since I left my jacket at home today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
