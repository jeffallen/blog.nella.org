      <title>Just Married</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been away from the web for a while because I was in Olivone, Ticino, Switzerland getting married!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to friends and family who came from so far away to witness such a special day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks also to our wonderful vendors, who made the day go so well. If you are thinking of putting on a wedding in Blenio, give these guys a call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels different to be married. It seems like it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; the house is the same, we still sleep on the same sides of the bed. But it&amp;rsquo;s different. Good. And safe. And happy. And&amp;hellip; different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Comparing Geographical Sizes</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2009/03/22/comparing-geographical-sizes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago I thought it would be fun to open two windows and see two things on Google Maps next to each other. That way, I could compare the sizes of them. But getting the scale set the same on both maps was not easy. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be neat if the scale of the maps was set to the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to implementing this with Google Maps API:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vanity Fair on Iceland</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2009/03/10/vanity-fair-on-iceland/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.nella.org/?p=569</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I became aware of Iceland&amp;rsquo;s bankruptcy through a curious route. A local geek mailing list &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.google.com/group/geekup/browse_thread/thread/754965a91630114&#34;&gt;had a posting&lt;/a&gt; from a friend of one of the guys on the list. She was Icelandic, and she was really in distress &amp;ndash; able to understand how serious the situation was, unable to understand it at the same time, scared for the future, and reaching out to a friend. It was really touching. I replied to the guy that it was a shame I couldn&amp;rsquo;t access any of the Icelandic news as an English speaker, and that perhaps his friend would like to start a blog translating it, so that I could understand her country&amp;rsquo;s situation better. I offered to donate some money for the service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/13/terrible-apartment-a.html&#34;&gt;This posting&lt;/a&gt; on Boing Boing reminded me of something I wanted to mention about Switzerland. Though I sometimes makes it sound like heaven, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.nella.org/?p=283&#34;&gt;beautiful Swiss girls&lt;/a&gt; begging to marry you, &lt;a href=&#34;http://walking.about.com/od/traileurope/ig/Swiss-Cows/&#34;&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt; that give chocolate milk when you milk them, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.nella.org/?p=473&#34;&gt;every man with an assault rifle&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s not the whole truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss landlords are crazy. And Swiss people, who have a certain zeal for social harmony, indulge them. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Malaria Medicine Advice</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2008/12/13/malaria-medicine-advice/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend sent me this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of healthy, when you&amp;rsquo;re in Africa, do you take malaria medication the whole time you&amp;rsquo;re there? Is 45 days too long to take it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, taking it 45 days is no big deal. It&amp;rsquo;s taking it for months on end (9, 18, 60) that is not recommended &amp;ndash; not because of actual risks, but because of not enough study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, here&amp;rsquo;s Jeff&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;cut-through-the-crap&amp;rdquo; guide to malaria meds:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Interview with a DVD-man</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2008/11/15/an-interview-with-a-dvd-man/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rare is the dinner in an expat restaurant in Africa which is not (politely and quietly) interrupted by a DVD-man. They have a stock of DVD&amp;rsquo;s in their backpacks, and work their way through the restaurant giving you a chance to peruse their wares. You have to see the DVDs to believe them, they are made up of several pirated Hollywood movies, with many different versions, all on one disc, enclosed in a professional-looking full color envelope. They have titles like &amp;ldquo;Segal vs Chan&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; a DVD full of Steve Segal and Jackie Chan movies. Another great title is &amp;ldquo;Superhero Schoolwork&amp;rdquo;, including Spiderman, Superman, and Wonderwoman (and all the sequels thereof). The DVD&amp;rsquo;s are billed as &amp;ldquo;50 in one&amp;rdquo;, though it requires some clever counting to find 50 movies on one disc. Typically, there are more like 12 movies on a DVD &amp;ndash; in itself an impressive achievement of DVD mastering and compression-algorithm optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Too Much Travel is Bad for the Soul</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting little nugget of reality near the end of the first page of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.salon.com/tech/col/smith/2008/10/17/askthepilot294/&#34;&gt;Ask the Pilot&lt;/a&gt; this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have grown more cynical in recent years, it is travel, I think, that has pushed me in this direction. Exploring other parts of the world is beneficial in all the ways it is typically given credit for&amp;hellip; But traveling can also burn you out, suck away your faith in humanity. You will see, right there in front of you, how the world is falling to pieces; the planet has been ravaged, life is cheap, and there is little that you, as the Western observer, with or without your good conscience, are going to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I last wrote from Padang, where we were looking into the state of the technology and looking to see if NGOs responding to the earthquake there needed help with it. What we found is that the technology needs were well in hand, either because the needs were not dire or because people had what they needed already. We met the operator of a small wireless ISP who educated us on where he buys equipment, how much locally purchased things like towers cost, and so on. It was a really excellent visit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have neglected to write an update for a very long time. Here&amp;rsquo;s a tiny update to give you a taste of things to come in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got back from Morocco and settled into my home away from home in Switzerland. I met Marina, a former coworker from MSF who I met in Liberia. We traveled around Switzerland seeing old friends of hers. I practiced some Italian, went cross country skiing, and spent quite a while sick as a dog from a stupid cold I got in Ticino.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visiting the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2007/01/31/visiting-the-atlas-mountains-and-the-sahara/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2007 10:06:57 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.nella.org/?p=269</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got back a few days ago from a big trip across southern Morocco. I signed up for a four day trip but it got extended to a five day trip because a storm came in and dumped snow in the pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing I remember from the trip is how cold it was! The weather in Morocco is about like weather in California. It gets cold in the winter, cold enough that we all have heaters in our houses. This is the difference between rich pampered Americans and Moroccans. They know the cold only lasts through January and February so they just put on a coat and a blanket and get on with it. The problem is that there is literally nowhere that is heated, so you spend days and days never really getting warm. Like you come in out of the van with windows that don&amp;rsquo;t quite close and a heater that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work, and you go into the restaurant which is really just a terrace and a kitchen, then after you check in to your room where the tile construction makes it feel just like a meat locker. The hotels do not have hot water, or certainly not enough to take a shower. When I put water into the sink to wash and warm my hands the sink itself cooled the water down to less than lukewarm as it was filling!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lost in the Souk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been in Marrakech two days now and I have been lost in the souk (marketplace) at least three times. Far from being a problem, that means I am doing things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After traveling in Dakar, the touts, faux guides, and various other types of urchin are no problem for me. In fact, as they are incredibly effective at reading people, I get approched a lot less because they can see that they will have no power over me. Still, I get my share of them. I turned into an alley yesterday and immediately realized it was a mistake because this guy launched into a speech. I ignored him furiously, staring at my feet and pretending to be deaf. Out of desperation he started guessing nationalities: Vous etes francais? American? Spanish? Greek? England? Taiwanese?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am still alive! Just a little post to keep something on the front page of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in Rome right now staying with the lovely and hospitable Kristin. Tomorrow I fly to Paris and meet the lovely and resourceful Lisa, who has scored us a room with the lovely and hospitable Nancy. In Paris, I will take Lisa to the lovely and educational Musee de Orsay, then go to MSF France to beg for a DVD of training films. I am heading on to Morocco to meet the handsome and helpful Aly, who will send me into the Atlas mountains on the back of a slovenly and surly ass, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am back at Accra, at the same place I stayed in the first night. Not very adventurous, but it has Internet and hot water, and is in a nice neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick list of things I did while I was here: bought some craft items, saw the fort at Cape Coast, walked on the catwalk at Kakama National Park, swam (pool and ocean), got a mild sunburn from being too relaxed to even notice, had a massage, listened to drums over a bonfire. I am leaving out the less-than-glamorous things that always happen in a week of traveling. It was a nice week, and I&amp;rsquo;m rested enough to go back to Nimba.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello from Ghana</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2006/10/09/hello-from-ghana/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.nella.org/?p=256</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve made it to (and past) the halfway point. I am on my vacation in Ghana and I thought I would give you all an update of what it islike to go from a post-conflict context to one of the richest countries in West Africa in 24 hours. In a few words, culture shock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture shock started as we drove out of Nimba. I had been out as far as Phebe Hospital, where the two cars meet when we do a &amp;ldquo;kiss movement&amp;rdquo; which is where one car leaves from Monrovia and one from Nimba at the same time, then they both meet in the middle. I rode out to Phebe hospital with our normal driver, Elijah, and read my Lonely Planet for West Africa on the way. I played with a kid in the car (a patient with a broken leg, who I coincidently mett while riding in the car weeks ago), giving him my little Altoids container with a rock inside it to rattle, and also making a paper airplane for him. Then we tranferred into the car from Monrovia, and that&amp;rsquo;s when the culture shock started to set in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got back home to Redwood City on Friday. The drive was uneventful. The puppy dog seemed a little sad to leave Roseburg, where Mom had made a comfortable home for Kat, and had spoiled her rotten. But after a bit, she got back in the swing of being a traveling dog, and settled down in her crate in the car. When we arrived at my house on Arch Street, I excitedly told Kat that we were home and showed her around. She seemed scared and uncomfortable&amp;hellip; afterall, this was just another place I was dumping her and (in her eyes) threatening to leave her again. After I set up a comfortable little temporary pen for her in the garage, she settled down a bit. We took a nice walk around the neighborhood yesterday and she liked that a lot. Everyone who saw her stopped to say hi. Everyone loves a puppy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on my way home across country. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a couple of traveling companions, Angela and Kat. Angela is a girl from Alaska with family in Oregon. Kat is a puppy. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a dog named Kat. (See below for more on Kat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left Saturday, going to Mobile AL to drop off Angela&amp;rsquo;s car. We spent the night in Rayville, LA with Sharon Dearman (wife of Mac, my boss at Radio Response). The next morning we drove to Dallas, and saw Cliff McCarthy there for a late lunch. After that we tried hard to get out of Texas in a day, but predictably failed: no one escapes Texas in a day. (But I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report, the puppy did choose to poop on Teaxs, which delighted me.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Football in Guatemala, Now Back in California</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2005/09/10/football-in-guatemala-now-back-in-california/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.nella.org/?p=189</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am back home in California. I had a safe and comfortable trip from San Pedro to Guatemala City, then on to San Francisco by three American Airlines flights stopping in Dallas and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Guatemala City, I got to go with Ben, his girlfriend and her brother to the World Cup qualifying game between Guatemala and USA. Ben and Maria had a Guatemala jersey for me to borrow, so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand out too much as a gringo and get us all killed. They also asked me several times pointedly who I was going to be rooting for. (I assured them Guatemala!) The reason for their concern is that they had bought preferred tickets for the Guatemala section. The stadium is laid out into several sections. The cheap seats are on each end. They go for Q50. Our section was on the sidelines on the far side from the sky boxes and the TV cameras. We paid Q150 ($20) for our seats. There was a tiny section devoted to the visiting team&amp;rsquo;s fans (in this case, about 35 ex-pat Americans, flags waving proudly). All of the sections had huge barbed-wire fences bordering them. The visiting team section also had a line of guards protecting it on each side. Also, there was a huge fence with several layers of barbed wire and concertina wire between the stands and the game. You actually watch the game through chain link fence. There were security guards with riot shields on the edge of the field. There were emergency exits out of the chain link cages we were in but they were chained closed. There was a fireman stationed at every exit who&amp;rsquo;s job was to stand holding the release device on the chain for the entire night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a really deep question, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, it was esay. With help from my parents and grandparents, I traded in my complicated itinerary home for a simple e-ticket on American Airlines from Guatemala City to San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old itinerary involved a too-expensive flight from Guatemala to Cancun, or a really long bus ride, followed by traveling standby out of Cancun. The new itinerary has all the random earth-bound connections taken out, and replaces them with a boring old two-stop flight directly to SFO via Dallas and Los Angeles. And it didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly break the bank, because I told a teensy weenie lie to American Airlines and told them I was sure I could fly back to Guatemala City on Oct 8. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I am really in a position to keep that promise to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over this year, some people have asked me, &amp;ldquo;Why do you seek to work for an international organization when there are so many problems that need to be solved inside the US?&amp;rdquo; It is a good question, and until Hurricane Katrina, my answer was, &amp;ldquo;I choose to work overseas because the US has enough good people, who can&amp;rsquo;t leave their families and work overseas, and who time and again give their time inside the US.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick blog entry so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget to write down something funny that happened the other day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, I was served a dish which was very close to risotto, one of my favorite dishes of all time. I commented on it to Gladys, but she said, &amp;ldquo;No, it is just chicken and rice.&amp;rdquo; I then explained that in the US (and Italy, where it comes from) we use a kind of rice called aborrio rice ( &lt;em&gt;arroz aborrio&lt;/em&gt;) to make risotto. She chuckled and said, &amp;ldquo;You use boring rice?&amp;rdquo; ( &lt;em&gt;Â¿Usan arroz aburrido?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Quiero aprender las cosas principales que necesito aprobar antes llamo un mecÃ¡nico verdadero, y las cosas que puedo reparar facÃ­lmente con solamente mis manos y mente. Cuando navigaba en Wonderland, leÃ­a los libros sobre motores de mar, pero todavÃ­a necesito escuchar a un maestro y ver un motor verdadero. Varios veces preguntaba a personas como mis compaÃ±eros de trabajo y mi familia donde puedo encontrar un mecÃ¡nico, pero todos no sabÃ­an.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Last Chapter on Airtech</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I flew to Cancun using Airtech for just $250 round trip. What a deal! The only thing you have to do to get such a good price is not have any fixed plans and be willing to put up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.nella.org/archives/2005/06/air_hitching.html&#34;&gt;slightly bizarre&lt;/a&gt; customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I got this email from the President of AirTech. I asked him if I could post it because it seems to provide a fitting close to the story of my AirTech customer experience. He gladly gave his permission, and commented that one of the nice things about owning your own company is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what anyone else thinks. Indeed!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it had to happen sooner or later. The good news is I didn&amp;rsquo;t get hurt, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t get very much from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for a day trip to Santiago Atitlan yesterday. It is an easy trip; you just take the boat over and back. I was only planning on walking around town, seeing the market, having lunch, and coming home, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t take much with me, not even my backpack. Just my camera in one pocket, and my wallet in the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend one of Paulina&amp;rsquo;s daughters (Paulina is &lt;em&gt;mi abuela&lt;/em&gt; or grandmother, here) flew to Canada for a 4 month internship. She will be working with a program in Saskatchewan that provides services to rural communities. She&amp;rsquo;s pretty good at English (about as good as I am at Spanish, I guess), but she&amp;rsquo;ll be getting quite a lot more practice in Canada, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure! She will be in Vancouver the first week for some kind of orientation, then she will move to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan for the duration of her visit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon re-reading my own words, not even I could believe myself. How could the showers possibly be that scary? So I decided I should show you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.nella.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/wires.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.nella.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shower.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to a tall guy from Australia, who says that he gets shocks all the time, because he&amp;rsquo;s up so much closer to the showerhead. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether this is typical Aussie bluster, or if it&amp;rsquo;s true. I can only be thankful that I am much closer to the average (tall) Guatemalan&amp;rsquo;s size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working here in San Pedro for two weeks now, and I owe people an update on what I&amp;rsquo;m up to here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week, I slept in a hotel and ate at the house of my coworker&amp;rsquo;s parents. I was going to move in with them when they got a bed for their spare room, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a convenient one to borrow or buy. So, after a week in the hotel, I found the family I lived with before at the top of the hill and asked them for a room. They were delighted to have me back with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jarachik, one of the restaurants/hotels in town is owned by a father and son team from Holland. This week Hank, the father, died of heart failure. It was a big shock to such a little community, and he will be missed. His son has a good support network here, so hopefully he will find the strength to get sorted out in his new life alone (his mother is also dead).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just over one year since I&amp;rsquo;ve worked full time, and I thought it would be fun to make a bunch of lists of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done in that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 33000 miles by airplane, visiting 14 airports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 6000 miles by car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000 nautical miles by sailboat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1000 nautical miles on the Alaska Marine Highway (a car ferry)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of vehicles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Buses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pickup trucks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; dead goat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; dead goat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boats
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~evi/sailing.html&#34;&gt;Wonderland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferry from Haines, AK to Bellevue, WA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferry on Lake Geneva&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senegalese water taxi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lanchas&lt;/em&gt; in Guatemala&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A camel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A horse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My hiking boots&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayer en la noche, dormÃ­ en la hotel Sak&amp;rsquo;cari. Esta noche, voy a domir en el Hotel San Francisco, porque es mas barrato. En algunos dÃ­as, voy a moverme al casa de parientes de Juan, mi compaÃ±ero de trabajo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out things don&amp;rsquo;t go like you planned when you travel. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling pretty smug in Cancun, with my ticket bought, plenty of time to go around and get dinner, then shop for snacks on the bus, use the Internet, etc. Only problem was my watch was two timezones wrong, so I had two less hours than I thought. I feel so dumb now, because there were three things that should have tipped me off. First, the clock in the bus terminal. I ignored it because Mexican clocks are always about 2 hours off. It turns out the clocks that taught me the &amp;ldquo;always ignore the clocks in Mexico&amp;rdquo; rule were the ones in the Metro, where the time of day has little to do with getting a train. In a Mexican bus station, the clocks are right. In fact, they are right to the second, like in a Swiss train station!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, traveling with AirTech was a breeze, except for the having 12 different backup plans part. I simply showed up at the airport 2 hours early (no big deal for an international flight) and the nice lady behind the counter gave me a confirmed seat on the plane in minutes. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is not always like this, but it was pretty painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am booked on a 20:30 bus out of here, and will arrive in San Cristobal tomorrow around noon. (16 hours&amp;hellip; ugh!) That probably means I&amp;rsquo;ll be too late to get to Panajachel tomorrow, but it will give me plenty of time to arrange my ride to Pana for the next day. I happen to know a great hostel in San Cristobal from last time, so no problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;From Cancun, I will take an overnight bus to San Cristobal de las Casas. There, I&amp;rsquo;ll find myself a tourist bus making the trip to Panajachel and then onward via boat to San Pedro. The whole trip will last from early Thursday morning until Friday afternoon, if it all goes according to plan. But it&amp;rsquo;s likely something will go wrong along the line. So much the better, at least for the stories later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When an airplane is about to leave, and there&amp;rsquo;s still room on it (taking into consideration pre-planned, unchangeable limits, like &amp;ldquo;we only put in enough fuel for 170 people&amp;rdquo;) there are sometimes seats the airline would still like to fill, if they could get some money for them. They know about these seats so late, they cannot offer any kind of reservation system for them. They let third-parties sell vouchers to get people onto the planes, but the airlines don&amp;rsquo;t want the third parties competeing with them, so the third parties are prohibited from advertising. So there&amp;rsquo;s this little micro-industry of people who sell these vouchers, and you basically have to hear about it from someone who has done it to know about it. It&amp;rsquo;s called air-hitching, or standby travel. I heard about it from Erika of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pangaea.to/&#34;&gt;Pangaea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning I will be getting on my easyJet flight back to London. I have been having a nice time here, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve postponed and delayed and conveniently forgotten to write anything down about my time here until the absolute last second. Which is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to write in Spanish, to keep from losing what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far. But that takes a long time and there always seems to be something more interesting to do. At least some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing here are preparatory study for my RedR class next week, so it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have been completely slacking off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Geneva this morning to see my friend Sima, who I met in Montreal a long time ago. Better not to count the years back, at least in public. I will stay here a week or so. Sima and I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a plan, but it will involve a little of me on my own, since she has to work next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little globalization for you. All through my trip to Guatemala, I was haunted by this annoying song called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lyricstop.com/g/gasolina-daddyyankee.html&#34;&gt;Gasolina&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s like the song for the Macarena, but about gasoline. Well, if you listen to the lyrics and the interplay between the man and the woman, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear she&amp;rsquo;s not at a gas station when she chants, &amp;ldquo;Give me more gasoline!&amp;rdquo; Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So ends several days in Mexico City, and over two months in Guatemala and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time in Mexico City has been spent on three things: feeling a little crappy, being hassled moving around the city, and seeing cool stuff. So in absolute terms, I guess it was more bad than good, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I spent several relaxing days in Oaxaca. I spent a morning doing museums. I found an artist I think Evi would like. I kept hoping some of his seascapes would have a sailboat instead of big passenger ships, but no luck. I think it was Francisco Guiterrez, but I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at rememberinbg artist names.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anteayer, pensÃ© no visitar Oaxaca porque el viajar allÃ­ tomarÃ­a demasiada hora. Pero encontrÃ© un bus de la noche de Palenque a Oaxaca. Etonces, llegÃ© en Palenque para los 8 horas de la maÃ±ana y salÃ­ a los 5 horas de la tarde. Dos noches en buses serÃ­an mortal en Guatemala, pero el buses de Mexico son mucho mas confortable que lo. De hecho, los buses de Mexico son mas confortable que todos lo que voy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I left San Pedro yesterday and started my trek north to Mexico City. Yesterday morning as I got ready to leave I thought I might go to Chichicastenango for the world famous market. But it turns out I was off by a day and would have needed to kill some time. Time is not on my side right now, as there are lots of fun things between here and Mexico City airport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Son los mismos como la medicina norteamericano &amp;ldquo;Pepto Bismol&amp;rdquo;, pero sin la tinta rosa. Etonces tomÃ© por tres comidas. Tambien, tomÃ© mi doxycyclin, quel traÃ© por eso razÃ³n.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spanish speakers&amp;hellip; put on your thinking caps. This entry will be using a fair amount of imperfect tense, because it is doing double duty as a homework assignment. If you don&amp;rsquo;t remember how to decode it, just strip off terminations like -Ã­an and -aban to get back to the root verb. Ready? Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mi fin de semana fue divertido. Todos los fin de semanas viajaba a algunas nuevos lugares en Guatemala. Este fin de semana, viajÃ© a Monterrico en sur de Guatemala, en la costa del mar pacifico.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Â¡Ahora, ese diario tiene dos idiomas, espaÃ±ol e ingles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estoy muy contento con mi decisiÃ³n para viajar a San Pedro. Ese ciudad estÃ¡ en la mitad entre San AndÃ©s y Xela. No es desmasiado poqueÃ±o, y tambien no es desmasiado grande. San Pedro me recuerda de San AndrÃ©s por que el tiene una buena vista del lago y montaÃ±as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mi familia aquÃ­ es fabulosa. La casa es nueva, con agua caliente en la ducha. La casa recibe brisas frescas de la montaÃ±as. Los mismos brisas hace olas muy grande en Jabalito en el otre lado del lago, pero aquÃ­ pienso no hay muchas olas en la tarde. Â¡Estes bueno por a nadar! Tal vez, maÃ±ana voy a nadar en el lago. Mi madre cocina la misma comida de mi madre en San AndrÃ©s. Â¡Me gusto! Para desayuno comÃ­ tres panqueques y atol de plantano sazonÃ³ con canela. Para almuerzo, comÃ­ pollo con tomates, arroz, y tortillas. Â¡Por fin, mi mano izquierdisto estuvo occupado!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As predicted in my last post, I decided to ditch Xela and find someplace else to study for the next two weeks. Because I liked Lake Atitlan so much, and because I am trying to meet up with Ben from Planet Online to explore the possibility of working for them for a few months, I decided to plan myself in San Pedro a little village on lake Atitlan. I have not been there yet but it seems to be much more like San AndrÃ©s, which I liked so much, so I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few days to settle in to Xela now, so here&amp;rsquo;s some info about life here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xela is Guatemala&amp;rsquo;s second biggest city, but it is a distant second to Guatemala City, with only 120,000 residents. It has several universities, so it is rumored to have the benefits of a university town. I did notice a flyer for a tofu store last night, so I guess that&amp;rsquo;s one of the benefits (?) of a university town. However, it is still a big city, which turned out to be a real shock to my system. I knew it was a city when I decided to come here, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how accustomed I had become to rural Guatemala. The city is dirty and noisy and drove me crazy for the first little bit. I might still flee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I arrived in Xela, and have found my Spanish school, and the house where I will be staying. It is not as opulent as my last house, but &lt;em&gt;mi madre&lt;/em&gt; seems much more communicative, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll feel a little more at home here, and a little less like a foreigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I found my school despite the best efforts of the Lonely Planet cartographers to leave me baffled on a street corner in Xela the rest of my life. New travel tip: use the addresses, not the dots on the maps. Apparently the dots are added to the map by a blind left handed dart thrower.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Guatemala Observations</title>
      <link>https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/07/more-guatemala-observations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some more random observations about Guatemala&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People say Americans are crazy gun toting cowbows, but the real Americans who love their guns are the Central Americans of Guatemala. I have never seen so many guns as I have here. That includes growing up in a working class, rural city in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see guns on the belts of police, and there are an average number of police here by US standards. But that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning&amp;hellip; lots of stores hire private security guards, and they are almost without exception armed. Every bank has an armed guard quickly questioning every person who wants to come through the door (one bank had a man-trap too, which is a pair of doors forming a vestibule, wired so that only one can be open at a time). Probably 70% of the delivery trucks have an armed security guard literally riding shotgun. When the truck stops, the guard gets out and watches the truck while the driver makes the delivery of Coca-Cola or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got to Antigual yesterday afternoon after a long bus ride most of the way aross Guatemala. From Puerto Barrios to Guatemala City it was pretty comfortable. We were on a Mercedes bus which dated to the 80&amp;rsquo;s, judging by the decor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invented another of my somewhat random travel tips. (You might remember the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.nella.org/archives/000128.html&#34;&gt;last one&lt;/a&gt;: when out of ideas on how to solve a problem, sit down and wait for something good to happen.) This tip is simpler: always sit on the side of the bus where a thief will pick up your luggage from. Here in Guatemala it is the right side, because they only load and unload it from that side. Then you can watch whenever bags come and go and see if any look a little too familiar. As it turns out, I need not have worried because they issued actual bag tags, and the guy actually checked the number before giving me my pack! That doesn&amp;rsquo;t even happen in Amerian airports!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made it out of Livingston this morning with no problems. My plan to stiff the hotel worked perfectly. I feel about this bad (fingers really close together), but I&amp;rsquo;m certain the hotel lady will find a way to get the money out of the guy. He eats at her house all the time. In fact, he did while he was scamming me, which is part of why I fell for it. Afterall, if the nice lady in the hotel feeds him, he&amp;rsquo;s got to be a good guy, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Livingston, a weird little leftover from the past. Here, a bunch of black people who speak Spanish live without any roads to the mainland. Their food is very different than mainland Guatemala, and they sprinkle Carribean slang into the middle of their Spanish. Kind of strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there are more hustlers here, and they are very good. So good in fact, I got cheated out of a tour this morning. Luckily I still had time to get signed up for another tour and take that. I have a plan to get almost all the money back that the guy nailed me for. He is in cahoots with the place I&amp;rsquo;m staying. I have not yet paid for the last night in the hotel, and it so happens the hotel price is just a few quezales less than the amount he cheated me out of. So I plan to stiff the hotel and leave a note telling them to get their money from him. The worst that happens is that the hotel lady calls the police on me, to whom I can explain that she helped her friend steal from me. Should be interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how it turns out, as long as there is Internet access in the Livingston jail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think, and wanted to put down some of the stuff I came up with in the last few weeks. Here&amp;rsquo;s a rather disorganized ramble of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guatemaltan Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guatemalan engineering is remarkably similar to Senegalese engineering. I think this stems from a basic prinicple at work in poor places, which is do it just well enough to get the job done, and cheaply as the job will tolerate. This is a common reaction sharp humans have all over the world, but in less developed economies, the handicraft of the clever engineers is somehow more on display.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After three weeks in San AndrÃ©s, I have decided to move on. A different crowd has moved into the city (I&amp;rsquo;m one of the old hands now!) and though some things are better, it feels like the right time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new crowd is a 40 person group from TrekForce.org.uk. They have had a 2 month adventure in Belize, and are now here for 4 weeks learning Spanish. There are four of them staying with my family, so it is easy to slack off and speak English instead of Spanish. In fact, it is required right now, because they don&amp;rsquo;t speak a word. Some are learning faster than others, but as 18 year old British youth, they don&amp;rsquo;t have very broad horizons and are taking a while to catch on to Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been off the radar for a while. The reason why is that the Internet is a 30 minute boat ride away, or a 1 hour bus ride. So I don&amp;rsquo;t get over here to Flores to send out updates very often. When I do, the unreliable power system has been foiling me. Last time I was in Flores, I hardly had enough time with power on to get critical stuff like bills taken care of. Then the power inside the Internet cafe failed, partially. During this week&amp;rsquo;s visit, we have already had two city-wide power outages, so I am going to be saving this early and often!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some answers to questions I have gotten&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, mom, I am drinking plenty of water. The water system in San AndrÃ©s apparently used to be unreliable, but seems to work fine now. However, it is untreated water, and used for everything but drinking. Drinking water is delivered by the &lt;em&gt;aqua pura&lt;/em&gt; man every morning (unless &lt;em&gt;mi madre&lt;/em&gt; yells &lt;em&gt;manaÃ±a&lt;/em&gt; out the door to him). I have no idea how much it costs, or when he gets paid. I suppose it is weekly or something. Drinking water is readily available at the school and at home, and I drink about a liter and a half every day, including several glases at dinner. Sometimes &lt;em&gt;mi madre&lt;/em&gt; serves heavily diluted pineapple juice instead of the fruit punch they call fresca. It tastes great!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I took a trip with some other gringos from San AndrÃ©s. We rented a minibus for the weekend and drove south to Semuc Champey. It is an area with lots of limestone and lots of water. Predictably, there are caves there, and other interesting things to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught the bus at 5 AM from the shack with no walls that serves as the bus station in San AndrÃ©s. We drove south for a couple of hours over fair roads, then headed up into the mountains. The driver knew a &amp;ldquo;short cut&amp;rdquo; that would make the trip take less&amp;hellip; something. We weren&amp;rsquo;t clear what, but he seemed to know where he was going. 6 hours later, after 70 kilometers of dirt road, we got there. It turned out that the short cut was meant to save diesel, and as we had neogotiated a fixed price for the trip out and back, it was to his advantage to try to save gas. I&amp;rsquo;m personally highly skeptical that a mountain road traveled at less than 20 km per hour saved any diesel over the slightly longer trip over pavement, but who am I to argue with a Guatemalan bus driver?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have more time to write today, so here is a better description of my new life for the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a look at how my day goes. At 5 am or so, the roosters start making noise, which in turn wakes up the pigs who make snuffling noises in the street. In some parts of town, diesel powered corn grinders start up to grind the corn for the morning torillas. One gringa friend of mine here has one next door, and cheerfully uses it as an alarm clock. There are happily none near me, so I can sleep in. (I think my mama gets her tortillas from a tortilleria down the road.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who have been wondering, I made it to little San Andrés, Guatemala and am settled in with my family. I do not have time for a full update today, but I am doing fine and am really happy with my choice of programs. Already I have had 5 hours of instruction and have homework, and got to visit an animal rehabilitation clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More in a few days when I get back to Flores. San Andres does not have Internet (but does have electricity, gas, and cold running water).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.nella.org/archives/000139.html&#34;&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt; was from New Years. I spent January in Arnold. I occupied myself there by working on DTN2, the reference implementation of the emerging &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dtnrg.org&#34;&gt;Disruption Tolerant Networking&lt;/a&gt; protocols. This work will be useful both for the Interplanetary Internet, and also for getting information to parts of the world where networks don&amp;rsquo;t reach reliably, like developing regions. For more information about how this (and other technology) can improve people&amp;rsquo;s lives in emerging regions, see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu&#34;&gt;TIER&lt;/a&gt; website at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, all my travel-watchers! Hope you all had a good holiday season. Thanks to those of you who put me up, and those others who asked, &amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I last sent out an update, I&amp;rsquo;ve returned to the US from Dakar, Senegal. I made my way home by a sequence of trips that, if the TSA had known about them, would have put me on the no-fly-list for life. I flew one way from Dakar to Lisbon, spent the night, then caught the second half of a round trip I bought back in October. I landed in New York and made a bus trip north to Boston, then spent several nice days there with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mit.edu/~jhango/&#34;&gt;Jennie Hango&lt;/a&gt;. It was cold outside, so we did traditional winter things like hang out and play video games, and make chicken soup from scratch. Jennie makes really good noodles, and she does it like an Italian grandmother, without a bowl; she just puts the eggs into the flour and goes for it with her fingers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Senegal Observations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some random observations about Senegal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must bargain over virtually every purchase. I would have thought that would drive me crazy, but you get used to it. And the Senegalese sense of humor makes it fun, since a huge part of the bargaining process is making the other guy laugh. If you are at a place where negotiations seem to be at an impasse and you add in some Wollof sprinkled with even more broken French, they crack up into gales of laughter, and give in on the price. Once a guy told me that he could not possibly go any lower because the money was for his mother. I countered, &amp;ldquo;But this is a Christmas gift for MY mother, and I cannot go any higher!&amp;rdquo; (Sorry Mom, it was actually something for me!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! We made it to Senegal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage was much easier than the last one. It was over 850 miles, so we were prepared for it to take over a week to get here. That&amp;rsquo;s a long time on a little boat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was pretty much in our favor all the time. That meant almost the entire way the wind was behind us, or on our port beam (perpendicular to the boat on the left side). When the wind is exactly behind you, you can put the main on one side and the jib on the other in a configuration called wing-on-wing. It&amp;rsquo;s really beautiful to behold! And it makes the boat go fast, so we got here in just 7 days!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crepes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was my night to cook dinner tonight. I&amp;rsquo;d been looking at the crepe page in the Moosewood cookbook for ideas for dinner crepes ever since I made them for breakfast a few days ago. They were a hit for breakfast, so I figured dinner was the logical next step!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moosewood suggested a spinach and ricotta filling. That sounded ok, but a little bit boring. I was also a little worried about finding ricotta here. Spanish supermercados are a little funny about cheese. There are often 15 variations on manchego, but no other kinds. Want parmesian, ricotta, or brie? Too bad!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Autopilots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I said before that on watch we only need to check for traffic and other changing conditions. If that&amp;rsquo;s all we have to do, then who&amp;rsquo;s steering? The answer is the autopilot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderland has two autopilots on board. The first one is an electronic one. The other one is analog and operates off of the power of the wind and the boat going through the water. They are both pretty interesting, so I&amp;rsquo;ll explain them both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Passagemaking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed I&amp;rsquo;m not sending out many updates. Plenty is going on, it&amp;rsquo;s just hard to squeze in time to go write an update at an internet cafe. So I&amp;rsquo;m trying a new system where I write updates offline when I get a chance, then upload them when I am online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last update was from Graciosa, a small island in the northeast of the Canaries. That&amp;rsquo;s where we made landfall after our passage. It was a great place to unwind from the passage-making lifestyle and get back into the cruising lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In the Canaries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I survived my first open ocean passage! We are now in the Canaries on an island named Graciosa. It is very rural, with no paved roads. All the cars here are Land Rovers and models of Toyotas meant for use in Africa! It&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat to be in a place so different in architecture from Europe. The culture here is still very European, which I guess is good, because it makes the culture shock less. As we head south toward Cape Verde, things will get increasingly less European.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can see Wonderland&amp;rsquo;s position by visiting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pangolin.co.nz/yotreps/tracker.php?ident=wdb2006&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will update it every day or so. The technology we use to do it is nifty. I&amp;rsquo;m learning lots of cool stuff about packet radio. I&amp;rsquo;ll write up some info on it when we get to the Canaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to boat chores. It really looks like we&amp;rsquo;ll make it out to sea today!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting Sail (maybe)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This might be my last entry from Ayamonte, Spain. We are working furiously to get all the last minute chores done to be ready to set sail for the Canary Islands this afternoon. The trip should take 5-7 days. I&amp;rsquo;ll be off the net until we arrive there, but I&amp;rsquo;ll send out an update as soon as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a great birthday dinner with Evi and the girls last night (thanks Evi!). We ate tapas until we almost burst. The baked tuna was really amazing, so we had two!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Through Portugal to Spain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I last wrote, I was on my way to Newark airport. The trip to there, then on to Lisbon was uneventful. Lisbon airport was small and efficient, so getting through the airport, then into the town center was also uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese sounds nothing at all like &amp;ldquo;Spanish with a French accent&amp;rdquo; as someone suggested to me. In fact, I never understood a single bit of Portuguese spoken to me the whole time I was there, it seems. It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to read, as it is a Romance language, and at this point my brain pretty much translates written Romance languages on the fly into English (that survival skill comes from all my time not speaking French in French speaking places). So I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly incommunicado, but close. The people are nice, and enough speak English to get by, but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first big trip after leaving Tellme has commenced!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this from Jim Fanning&amp;rsquo;s apartment in the Upper West Side of New York City. I got in yesterday at 3:30pm, and took the subway in. I had time to kill before visiting Doctors Without Borders/MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) for a prospective volunteer open house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through Grand Central Station on the way to the main branch of the public library. I gawked at both of those for a while, then walked along 42nd Avenue toward Times Square. I hit an internet cafe there, got dinner, and took the cab to MSF. Perfect timing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend is on her way to Budapest, and I wrote some of this to her. I&amp;rsquo;m copying it down here so that I don&amp;rsquo;t lose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Budapest in the fall of 2000 on my way to Oradea, Romania. There, I helped build a huge house to be used for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caminulfelix.org/&#34;&gt;family-style orphanage&lt;/a&gt;. It had 8 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 1.5 kitchens, 2 living rooms, and a dining room. We had to finish it from a finished foundation and framed walls to &amp;ldquo;pillows and sheets on the beds&amp;rdquo; in about 8 days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got home from a long visit with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caida.org/~kc&#34;&gt;kc&lt;/a&gt; in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Highway 101 down and most of the way back. It is so much nicer than I-5. Today, on the way back, I strayed from 101 and took some back roads. I ended up coming up state route 25 from south of Pinnacles National Monument. There are some absolutely stunning vistas down there. Was nice to trade some time for some driving on twisty roads with no traffic and no sprawling wasteland on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was up at Westerly this weekend, and wanted to go for an overnight camping trip while I was there. I decided to hike 4 miles up Noble Canyon to Noble Lake, then sleep under the stars and reverse the whole process Monday morning. I like summer camping trips like that, where you can keep the pack light by ditching the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive there, I noted a fair amount of thunderstorm activity. When I got to the trailhead, there was moderate to light thunderstorm activity. The clouds were all up above the top of the canyon, and I&amp;rsquo;d be hiking in the floor, with plenty of room between me and the storm. I decided to get hiking, and make one final go/no-go decision at 2 miles in. Either it would be a 4 mile day hike, or an overnight as planned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back from a really cool 2 week vacation sailing in Croatia. I&amp;rsquo;ll be filling in weblog postings for the days of vacation in a bit. For now, let me just say it was wonderful, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend Croatia to anyone!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
