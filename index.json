[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m learning Clojure, which is a modern Lisp, which is hosted on the JVM. I\u0026rsquo;m so far really liking the focus on integrating the benefits of functional programming into a modern environment. It is pragmatic and reasonable. It feels like programming for grown-ups, in the same way that Node.js feels like programming for people with more energy than sense.\nWhile riding on the train with my kids, I told them, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m learning this new language, let\u0026rsquo;s use it to make a card game since we don\u0026rsquo;t have any cards with us.\u0026rdquo; Clojure, as a Lisp, is meant to be usable interactively from a REPL and since I was on my phone in a train, I used an in-browser version of Clojure called ClojureScript. The one I used is at http://trycojure.org.\nSo, to play with cards, we need a deck. I used the for function to iterate over a pair of variables for the cards and the suits:\n(def deck (for [rank (take 13 (drop 1 (range))) suit [:♥️ :♦️ :♣️ :♠️]] {:rank rank :suit suit})) Range starts at 0, but cards run from 1 to 13. So we need to drop 1 off the front of range before taking 13 more items from the infinite list it provides.\nNow we can play with our deck a bit:\n; take the first 3 cards off and look at them (take 3 deck) \u0026gt; ({:rank 1, :suit :♥️} {:rank 1, :suit :♦️} {:rank 1, :suit :♣️}) ; take the next 3 cards off and look at them (take 3 deck) \u0026gt; ({:rank 1, :suit :♥️} {:rank 1, :suit :♦️} {:rank 1, :suit :♣️}) So we see two things there. First, we see how simple and beautiful it is to make an \u0026ldquo;object\u0026rdquo; in Clojure: just use a map to associate various types of data (including Unicode strings) together. Second we see the \u0026ldquo;consequences\u0026rdquo; of Clojure\u0026rsquo;s immutable data: taking the \u0026ldquo;first 3 cards\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;next 3 cards\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t do what you might expect: we get the same 3 cards, because both calls to take are making new 3 element immutable lists based off of the same original immutable list.\nSo then how do we deal out two hands of 3 cards? What we need to do is shuffle the cards, and then take our hands from this new list. We can take 3 for one hand and 3 for the other hand:\n(let [shuffled (shuffle deck) you (take 3 shuffled) me (take 3 (drop 3 shuffled))] {:you you :me me}) \u0026gt; {:you ({:rank 1, :suit :♦️} {:rank 12, :suit :♠️} {:rank 9, :suit :♣️}), :me ({:rank 8, :suit :♠️} {:rank 6, :suit :♣️} {:rank 6, :suit :♥️})} The key to getting the benefits of pure functions and immutable data structures is to adapt to them, instead of fighting them. So here, we need to put a name on the copy of the deck that\u0026rsquo;s been shuffled, so that we can take cards from the same shuffle for the two players.\nI wondered how shuffle works, and I got an interesting surprise when I looked at \u0026ldquo;view source\u0026rdquo; for it in VS Code. (I use VS Code and Calva to program Clojure. The first time I learned Lisp, in university, I was working within a not-very-good editor inside of a not-very-good Scheme implementation for MacOS System 7. It crashed a lot. The next time I re-learned Lisp was in 2006, when I did Abdulaziz Ghuloum\u0026rsquo;s step by step Scheme compiler tutorial. Then, I worked in Emacs, which I like. But I hate configuring Emacs, and so I was delighted when VS Code came on the scene and let me forget what microscopic amount of e-lisp I ever managed to learn.)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how Clojure implements shuffle:\n(defn shuffle \u0026#34;Return a random permutation of coll\u0026#34; {:added \u0026#34;1.2\u0026#34; :static true} [^java.util.Collection coll] (let [al (java.util.ArrayList. coll)] (java.util.Collections/shuffle al) (clojure.lang.RT/vector (.toArray al)))) That\u0026rsquo;s interesting because it demonstrates the Java interoperation part of Clojure. In general, the Clojure standard library has a lot of \u0026ldquo;batteries included\u0026rdquo;, and when it makes sense, they depend on existing \u0026ldquo;batteries\u0026rdquo; included in Java itself. In this case, they are using java.util.Collections\u0026rsquo; shuffle​(List\u003c?\u003e list), which shuffles in-place. That\u0026rsquo;s why they need to make a copy of the collection as an ArrayList and then construct a new Clojure vector from the array before returning it. Typical Java code does not use immutable data, and so when you do interoperation with it, getting the output data back to normal Clojure data structures as soon as possible is important to regain the benefits of immutable data.\nThere is another shuffle implementation in Java that allows you to pass in your own Random object. Using that, you\u0026rsquo;d be able to get deterministic shuffles, which is something we used when investigating how to put games on decentralized ledgers when I worked at DEDIS. As a way to play with Java interoperation in Clojure, perhaps I will try to make a deterministic shuffle.\nTo have some kind of game at all, I wanted to add up the cards. So I used reduce to do that. I had a lot of trouble understanding reduce the first few times I read about it, until I read what Clojure for the Brave and True had to say about it. Now I understand that reduce often means \u0026ldquo;go do this thing for each item in the list, and build up one result from visiting all those things\u0026rdquo;. That helped me see how to use it here to add cards:\n(defn add-cards [coll] (reduce #(+ % (:rank %2)) 0 coll)) ; a micro-unit test: the first 3 cards, all with rank 1, should add to 3 (= (add-cards (take 3 deck)) 3) \u0026gt; true Here we also see the supremely pragmatic technique in Clojure of using a keyword as a function. The underlying machinery that implements keywords in Clojure implements the IFn interface, which means you can call into it from Clojure. When a keyword is called, it looks at it\u0026rsquo;s first argument, and if it is a map, it will look itself up in the map. The smallest possible demonstration of this is: (= 3 (:rank {:rank 3})) -\u0026gt; true\nAnd so now, we just need to put it together into a boring little game, which though it bored my children to tears, at least helped me pass a little time on a long train trip and practice my new Clojure skills:\n(defn game [] (let [shuffled-cards (shuffle deck) you (take 3 shuffled-cards) me (take 3 (drop 3 shuffled-cards)) you-score (add-cards you) me-score (add-cards me)] {:you you :me me, :winner (if (\u0026gt; you-score me-score) :you :me)})) \u0026gt; (game) {:you ({:rank 5, :suit :♦️} {:rank 7, :suit :♣️} {:rank 3, :suit :♠️}), :me ({:rank 2, :suit :♠️} {:rank 7, :suit :♠️} {:rank 3, :suit :♦️}), :winner :you} \u0026gt; (game) {:you ({:rank 7, :suit :♦️} {:rank 12, :suit :♥️} {:rank 8, :suit :♥️}), :me ({:rank 12, :suit :♦️} {:rank 11, :suit :♦️} {:rank 5, :suit :♣️}), :winner :me} \u0026gt; (game) {:you ({:rank 4, :suit :♠️} {:rank 5, :suit :♦️} {:rank 5, :suit :♥️}), :me ({:rank 13, :suit :♠️} {:rank 5, :suit :♠️} {:rank 11, :suit :♥️}), :winner :me} I win!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2024/02/21/playing-cards-with-clojure/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m learning Clojure, which is a modern Lisp, which is hosted on the JVM.

How do you ask the kernel to help you make sure that a given piece of RAM never ends up on disk? There\u0026rsquo;s a hint here. I have not looked to see if this technique has been picked up by OpenSSL or BoringSSL. The way Akamai hooked it in to ASN.1 parsing ugly and gross and we won\u0026rsquo;t be doing that, but the kernel system calls they are using are interesting.\nmlock and madvise work at page granularity. Data structures exposed in Go programs are at byte granularity, so we\u0026rsquo;ll need some kind of technique to convince Go to put our data on a page all to itself. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that make([]byte, 0, pagesize) will probably do what we want. Once the underlying page is marked correctly, we return []byte to the caller. It is their responsibility to (1) never reallocate the underlying storage (i.e. only write into it via copy, never append) and (2) make sure that all of the places in the code where the private key is used do not make copies off of this secure page.\nThen we need to go hunting, looking for places that the Go runtime is going to make copies of our private key. This is easy but error-prone work (at least for a Go veteran, who can spot when a copy is happening), and it makes me wonder if undertaking a task like this in Rust would be easier; maybe you\u0026rsquo;d be able to mark the private key immutable and implement the Copy trait as panic, then see what broke? Although I think you would still need to audit the code, because it would be possible to copy out the bytes in a typesafe way, I think.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a list of places I\u0026rsquo;ve already noticed I\u0026rsquo;d need to work on:\nin Upspin\u0026rsquo;s factotum.go, the private key comes off disk and goes into memory. That\u0026rsquo;s in a []byte, so we\u0026rsquo;d be able to put it into our safe []byte, no problem. However it is converted to a string and then back into a []byte, which would have to be avoided. No biggie, and also some nice cleanup because stores the private key as a string (unused) and also an ecdsaKeypair. The ecdsa.PrivateKey ends up with a pointer in it to a big.Int, which has the private key in it. It gets there via UnmarshalText. But UnmarshalText converts to a string too, so it has to get fixed. It seems likely that UnmarshalText should be using Fscanf to read directly from the []byte it receives, since big.Int implements fmt.Scanner. While constructing the big.Int to hold the private key, there is a risk of leaving parts, or maybe all of the private key around in memory. This is because the final length of the underlying \u0026ldquo;words\u0026rdquo; array where the private key is stored is not known ahead of time to the math/big library. However, we do know how long the private key is going to be, so we can store a decoy private key into the big.Int to get it to stretch out it\u0026rsquo;s words slice, and then scan the real private key in, so that the word slice underlying array is never reallocated while reading the private key. However, there does not appear to be a way to tell big.Int where it should put the []Word. Due to type safety, it would require unsafe to do that. But it can be done in package factotum before the first call to Unmarshal. The implementation of big.Int.Bytes() is used from time to time, and it causes a copy of the private key to be made. It does not allow us to pass in \u0026ldquo;please write the bytes here\u0026rdquo; argument in order to make sure that it is copying the private bytes exactly where we want them to go (i.e. to the protected page). At first glance, this would appear to require a new API, which is too bad. The factotum package does not expose the private key, so it cannot be accessed outside of this package. That makes auditing usage of the key easy to make sure that it stays private. Thank you Upspin hackers! So, in summary, this is probably doable, except that controlling the backing store for the big.Int to be private requires unsafe-ness.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2017/07/24/protecting-private-keys-in-go/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday I was looking at Upspin and thinking about private keys.

Pure Rust code is also self contained in the program\u0026rsquo;s ELF file.

I remember the first time I started digging down into Go and realized that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t even linking libc, and it gave me a fantastic feeling of finally cutting the cord to the old, dangerous way of programming. With Rust (and hyper) we\u0026rsquo;re right back to depending on C again.

It is as if Thomas Edison came back to life and restated his maxim: \u0026ldquo;Reliability is 99.999% perspiration and 0.0001% downtime\u0026rdquo;.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not the end of the story. The other thing I felt time and time again reading the book was a sense of longing to get back in the game. It made me ready to sweat. The book, told as it is from passionate, proud, smart people who have been sweating in the trenches, is as intoxicating as a Crossfit Promotional Video.\nTo outsiders, who think the understand IT operations or Software Development based just on the English-language definitions of the constituent terms, SRE might look easy. But what I really liked about SRE book was how time and again through the book, it talked about how the values of SRE inform the successful approach to a certain problem. When a team needs to introspect on its values in order to choose a way forward, you are no longer in the realm of technology: that\u0026rsquo;s about culture.\nIn my last job, from the first moment, my colleagues looked to me to guide the culture of the team. My title was not \u0026ldquo;tech lead\u0026rdquo;, but there were some behaviors I knew we needed to be encouraging and I knew how to model them. Reading the SRE book triggered the same instincts in me again. A lot of the info in the SRE book I already had learned in my own way, from my own experiences. But lots of the information was a new take on the old problems I knew about, and inspired me to say, \u0026ldquo;wow, yes, of course that\u0026rsquo;s the answer, I\u0026rsquo;d like to be in a team that was acting like that!\u0026rdquo;\nBut the fact that integrating SRE into an organization is a cultural, not technical, affair dooms it to partial, spotty uptake. There will be organizations that don\u0026rsquo;t have the right kind of cultural flexibility and leadership who is able to bring people around to SRE. They will carry on with what they are doing, but they will pay the price by forgoing the benefits that Google has shown that SRE can bring to an organization. Their dev teams and ops teams will forever be locked in battle, and the only action item from their postmortems will continue to be \u0026ldquo;we need more change control meetings\u0026rdquo;.\nI pity the fools.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2016/06/14/the-sre-book/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/UKPbLsRdwAg?t=23m28s\"\u003egave a Lightning Talk\u003c/a\u003e at SREcon16 and I was lucky enough to win the SRE book from Google while I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some notes of things I was thinking while reading it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, this is a phenomenal piece of work, that really marks a special point in time: the dawn of the possibility of wide adoption of SRE principles.

Since thats a lot of that stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve never touched before (though I\u0026rsquo;ve read up on it, and it uses all the same general concepts I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with for 15 years) it should not be too surprising that I didn\u0026rsquo;t get it done. Yet.\nThe surprising thing is where I got stuck. I found a nice pair of Docker containers for Zookeeper and Kafka. I got Zookeeper up and running, and I could see it\u0026rsquo;s name in the Kubernetes DNS. My two Kafkas were up and running, and they found the Zookeeper via service discovery. So far so good. But then something went wrong with the place where I was going to run clients from; it could not talk to either of the Kafkas via TCP, connection timed out. What\u0026rsquo;s more, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure that both of my Kafkas were even being advertised by Kubernetes DNS.\n(Shower thought after writing this: perhaps my client container was started before the Kafka one, and as a result, it didn\u0026rsquo;t have the correct container-to-container networking magic set up. It would be interesting to read up on how that works and then debug it to see if I can see the exact problem. Or it might go away the next time I start the containers, this time in the right order. But\u0026hellip; how can order matter? This would make it very difficult to operate these things.)\nLearning how to debug in the container environment is one of the hardest things. It\u0026rsquo;s like walking around in a brewery in the dark armed only with a keychain flashlight and your nose, looking for the beer leak.\nI think it is time to take a break from container-ville and use small, local Kafka on my Mac to develop the synthetic load generator. That will also be interesting, because I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to be able to generate spiky, floody flows of messages using feedback from producers to consumers. It is actually something I\u0026rsquo;ve had in mind for years, and never had the right situation calling on me to finally try it out.\nUpdate: Well the load generator was fun hacking/learning. The final step would be to put it all together.

I thought I would make a post about what\u0026rsquo;s in my head, both as a way to solidify it (no better way to learn something than by teaching it) and in case this interview goes bad, so that my next prospective employer can see what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about.\nIf you, my current prospective employer are reading this, would you please not take advantage of this by removing these questions from your list? Come on guys, give me a break. If I\u0026rsquo;m going to be transparent in my thought processes, the least you can do is throw me a bone and ask at least one of these in person!\nQuestion 1: Make something faster.\nI think this would be an interesting question. Especially if it was literally asked in these words. The interviewee asks, \u0026ldquo;make what faster?\u0026rdquo; The interviewer says, \u0026ldquo;Whatever. Tell me about making something faster. Whatever you want to tell me about.\u0026rdquo;\nThis would be a fun question because it would test the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s ability to organize his/her thoughts, select the relevant ones, and present them. In fact, it is checking the interviewee\u0026rsquo;s ability to teach, which is a required skill for someone with like me (with a grey beard). You deliver the most value on a team not by pulling 80 hour weeks yourself, but by mentoring people so that the 4 people in your team manage (together) a 160 hour week, instead of the 60-80 hours of useful progress they might have managed without your (theoretically) sage advice.\nMy answer would be the following:\nThere are three possibilities for how to make something faster. First, you can not do it at all. Not doing it is an infinite speedup over doing it. How? Caching, usually. And hey, caching is easy. As easy as naming.\nSecond, you can do it better, by choosing a better algorithm, representation, or by doing less work. I might retell a story Átila told me about a challenge in which the right answer could be got with less than half the data sorted (he wrote his own quicksort that let him find the answer before finishing the sort, thereby blowing other contestants out of the water; they all did quicksort to completion, then looked for the answer in the sorted list). I also happen to have spotted a place in my prospective employer\u0026rsquo;s product where I could propose to change the representation, in order to reduce the compute power necessary to parse something. It takes an arrogant little prick to use the company\u0026rsquo;s own software as an example of what not to do, but depending on the feeling I have with the interviewer, I might do it.\nThird, you can take the solution you have now, and optimize it. To do that, you measure, profile, tweak, and then measure again. I checked some code into the Go standard library that does that, and one of those would make a nice story.\nQuestion 2: How would you add load shedding to the Go standard library\u0026rsquo;s HTTP server?\nI thought of this question while reading chapter 22 of the new SRE book from Google and O\u0026rsquo;Reilly.\nThere are two layers where you could implement it. The \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; way to do it is the arrange that the server sends back a properly formatted error 503 via HTTP. Another way that you could do it would be to accept and close the connection immediately. Which you choose depends on who you think your clients are, and how you think they will respond to the two kinds of errors.\nThe \u0026ldquo;accept and close\u0026rdquo; technique should be capable of more \u0026ldquo;!QPS\u0026rdquo; (non-answered queries per second) because it can theoretically handle each reject without spawning a new goroutine. Goroutines are cheap, but they imply at least one mutex (to add the goroutine into the scheduler), some memory pressure (for the stack), and some context switches. Implementing this would be a simple matter of wrapping the net.Listener with our own, which intercepted Accept to do \u0026ldquo;accept and close\u0026rdquo; when load shedding is needed.\nI just went to read the source, and the way Accept is called, it must return a valid connection and no error. So our load-shedding Accept needs to actually be a loop, where we accept and close until the logic decides it is time to finally let a connection through (i.e. \u0026ldquo;if load shedding then allow 1 in 100 connections\u0026rdquo; or whatever), and then we need to return with that connection.\nSo how to implement the other one? What you want is an http.HandlerFunc wrapper. Except: what if libraries you don\u0026rsquo;t control are registering handlers? How can you be sure your load shedding wrapper is always the first one called, so that it can send an error 503? I thought I had a solution to this, but it turns out that http.ServeMux is not an interface, but a concrete type. So it is not possible to trap http.ServeMux.Handle, and ensure that the load shedder is always on the front. This one is going to take some more thinking.\nOf course there\u0026rsquo;s always monkey patching in Go which could be used to arrange for HandleFunc and friends to always arrange to put a load shedder on the front of the call chain. But not in production. Please, God, not in production.\nQuestion 3: A coding challenge I found on Glassdoor\nThis one is a legitimate coding challenge, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to post either the question or the answer here, because that\u0026rsquo;s just not cool. But it did lead me to an interesting observation\u0026hellip;\nAfter a little workout in the coding dojo (I slayed the challenge!) I hit the showers. And in the shower, I had an idea: what if you could interpret the []byte that you get from go-fuzz as input to this code challenge? Then I could fuzz my routine, looking for ways to crash it. I quickly got it working, but ran up against the fundamental problem of fuzzing. When your input is random, for lots of problems, it is hard to check the output to know if it is the right output for the given input. You have one routine right there that could check it, but it is the routine-under-test, and thus using it would be cheating (and pointless). The bottom line, which I already knew, is that fuzzers can only find crashes, not incorrect behavior.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2016/05/31/interview-questions-i-hope-i-get/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have an interview coming up, and so my \u0026ldquo;keep in shape hacking time\u0026rdquo; has been recently devoted to interview preparation.

While the conditions of open source work are often somewhat different than paid work, a person\u0026rsquo;s manner of expressing themselves (both interpersonally, on issue trackers for example and in code) is likely to tell you more about their personality than you can learn in the fake environment of an interview.\nI am currently starting a job search for a full time job in the Lausanne, Switzerland area (including as far as Geneva and Neuchâtel) with a start date of February 1, 2024. Touching up my résumé is of course on my todo list. But it is more fun to look at and talk about code, so as a productive procrastination exercise, here\u0026rsquo;s a guided tour of my open source contributions.\nI currently work with Vanadium, a new way of making secure RPC calls with interesting naming, delegation and network traversal properties. I believe wide-scale adoption of Vanadium would make IoT devices less broken, which seems like an important investment we need to be making in infrastructure right now.\nI introduced fuzz testing of the VOM decoder, which found several critical remotely exploitable crashes. I am working on an experimental miniature version of Vanadium in C that would be suitable for small embedded devices too small to run Go. I have been an occasional contributor to the Go standard library since 2011. Some examples I am particularly proud of include:\nI profiled the bzip2 decoder and realized that the implementation was cache thrashing. The fixed code is smaller and faster. I noticed that the HTTP implementation (both client and server) was generating more trash than was necessary, and prototyped several solutions. The chosen solution was is in this checkin. This was, for a while, the most intensely exercised code I\u0026rsquo;ve written in my career; it saved one allocation per header for most headers processed by the billions of HTTP transactions that Go programs do all around the world. It was later replaced with a simpler implementation that was made possible by an optimization in the compiler. The same allocation reduction technique was carried over into Go\u0026rsquo;s HTTP/2 implementation too, it appears. I improved the TLS Client Authentication to actually work. I needed this for a project at work. I wrote an MQTT server in Go in order to learn the protocol for work. It is by no means the fastest, but several people have found that the simplicity and idiomaticity of its implementation is attractive. It ships as part of the device software for the Ninja Sphere.\nI found an interesting change to reduce network overhead in the MQTT serializer I used. Copies = good, more syscalls and more packets = bad. I worked on control software for a drone in Go for a while. It still crashes instead of flying, but it was an interesting way to learn about control systems, soft realtime systems, websockets, and Go on ARM.\nI have written articles about Go on this blog since I started using it in 2010. Some interesting ones in particular are:\nSeeking around in an HTTP object Type safety saves the day again A trip down the (split) rabbithole I am also active on the Golang sub-reddit, where I like answering newbie requests for code reviews. I also posed a challenge for the Golang Challenge.\nMy earliest open source project that\u0026rsquo;s still interesting to look at today was a more scalable version of MRTG called Cricket. Today tools like OpenTSDB and Graphite are used for the same job, it seems. Cricket still works to the best of my knowledge, but development is dead because of lack of interest from users. Cricket is written in Perl.\nMy earliest open source project was Digger, from Bunyip. If you can unearth archeological evidence of it from the 1996 strata of the Internet geology, you\u0026rsquo;re a better digger than I am.

You don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s got what you are looking for, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to download the whole thing. Is it possible to do something like \u0026ldquo;unzip -l https://example.com/giant.zip\u0026quot;?\nThis is not a theoretical problem just to demonstrate something in Go. In fact, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking to write an article at all, except that I wanted to know the structure of the bulk patent downloads from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from those ZIP files. Or, I thought, how cool would it be to be able to fetch individual images of some of the patents issued in 1790 out of these tarfiles?\nGo take a look. There\u0026rsquo;s hundreds of huge ZIP and tarfiles to explore there!\nThe ZIP file format has a table of contents in it, located at the end. So on local disk, \u0026ldquo;unzip -l\u0026rdquo; is as simple as \u0026ldquo;seek to the end, find the TOC, parse it and print it\u0026rdquo;. And in fact, we can see that\u0026rsquo;s how Go is going to proceed, because the zip.NewReader function wants a file it will be able to seek around in. As for tar files, they were designed for a time when tape streamed and memory was scarce, so their table of contents is interleaved among the files themselves.\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re not on local disk, we\u0026rsquo;ve given ourselves the challenge of reading from a URL. What to do? Where to start?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple things to check and then we can plan a way forward. The equivalent of seeking and reading from a file for HTTP is the Range header. So, do the USPTO servers support the Range header? That\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to check using curl and an HTTP HEAD request:\n$ curl -I https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/patent/officialgazette/2017/e-OG20170103_1434-1.zip HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2017 21:10:26 GMT Server: Apache Last-Modified: Tue, 03 Jan 2017 11:58:45 GMT ETag: \u0026#34;afb8ac8-5452f63e0a82f\u0026#34; Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 184257224 X-Frame-Options: DENY Content-Type: application/zip Note the \u0026ldquo;Accept-Ranges\u0026rdquo; header in there, which says that we can send byte ranges to it. Range headers let you implement the HTTP equivalent of the operating system\u0026rsquo;s random-access reads (i.e. the io.ReaderAt interface).\nSo it would theoretically be possible to pick and choose which bytes we download from the web server, in order to download only the parts of a file that have the metadata (table of contents) in it.\nNow we need an implementation of the ZIP file format that will let us replace the \u0026ldquo;read next table of contents header\u0026rdquo; part with an implementation of read that reads only the metadata, using an HTTP GET with a Range header. And that is where Go\u0026rsquo;s archive/zip and archive/tar packages come in!\nAs we\u0026rsquo;ve already noted, zip.NewReader is chomping at the bit to start seeking. However as we take a look at TAR, we find a problem. The tar.NewReader method takes an io.Reader. The problem with the io.Reader is that it does not let us get random access to the resource, like io.ReaderAt does. It is implemented that way because it makes the tar package more adaptable. In particular, you can hook the Go tar package directly up to the compress/gzip package and read tar.gz files \u0026ndash; as long as you are content to read them sequentially and not jump around in them, as we wish to.\nSo what to do? Use the source, Luke! Go dig into the Next method, and look around. That\u0026rsquo;s where we\u0026rsquo;d expect it to go find the next piece of metadata. Within a few lines, we find an intriguing function call, to skipUnread. And there, we find something very interesting:\n// skipUnread skips any unread bytes in the existing file entry, as well as any alignment padding. func (tr *Reader) skipUnread() { nr := tr.numBytes() + tr.pad // number of bytes to skip tr.curr, tr.pad = nil, 0 if sr, ok := tr.r.(io.Seeker); ok { if _, err := sr.Seek(nr, os.SEEK_CUR); err == nil { return } } _, tr.err = io.CopyN(ioutil.Discard, tr.r, nr) } // Note: This is from Go 1.4, which had a simpler skipUnread than go 1.9 does. The type assertion in there says, \u0026ldquo;if the io.Reader is actually capable of seeking as well, then instead of reading and discarding, we seek directly to the right place\u0026rdquo;. Eureka! We just need to send an io.Reader into tar.NewReader that also satisfies io.Seeker (thus, it is an io.ReadSeeker).\nSo, now go check out package github.com/jeffallen/seekinghttp and see how we accomplish that.\nThis package implements not only io.ReadSeeker, but also io.ReaderAt. Why? Because, as I mentioned above, reading a ZIP file requires an io.ReaderAt. It also needs the length of the file passed to it, so that it can look at the end of the file for the table of contents. The HTTP HEAD method works nicely to get the Content-Length of the HTTP object, without downloading the entire thing.\nA command-line tool to get the table of contents of tar and zip files remotely is in remote-archive-ls. Turn on the \u0026ldquo;-debug\u0026rdquo; option in order to see what\u0026rsquo;s happening. It is fascinating to watch as the TAR or ZIP readers from Go\u0026rsquo;s standard library \u0026ldquo;call back\u0026rdquo; into our code and ask for a few bytes here, a few bytes there.\nSoon after I first got this program working, I found a serious flaw. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example run:\n$ ./remote-archive-ls -debug \u0026#39;https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/patent/grant/multipagepdf/1790_1999/grant_pdf_17900731_18641101.tar\u0026#39; 2017/12/12 00:07:38 got read len 512 2017/12/12 00:07:38 ReadAt len 512 off 0 2017/12/12 00:07:38 Start HTTP GET with Range: bytes=0-511 2017/12/12 00:07:39 HTTP ok.

Can you see the problem? That\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot of HTTP transactions! The TAR reader is working through the TAR stream a little bit at a time, issuing a stream of tiny reads. All of those short HTTP transactions are hard on the server, and terrible for our throughput, since each one entails many round-trips to the server.\nThe solution, of course, it caching. Instead of reading just the first 512 bytes that the TAR reader asks for, I read 10 times that many, so that the next several reads will be serviced directly from cache. If there is a read that is outside of the cache, we assume that the other reads will come in that area as well, and drop the entire current cache, in order to fill it with 10x the current read amount from the new current offset.\nThe fact that the TAR reader sends a lot of small reads points out something very important about buffering. Giving the results of os.Open directly to tar.NewReader isn\u0026rsquo;t very clever, especially if your plan is to jump through the file looking for metadata. While it is true that *os.File implements io.ReadSeeker, we now know that TAR is going to issue a huge number of small system calls to the kernel. The solution, much like caching was the solution above, might be to use the bufio package to buffer the *os.File, so that the small reads that TAR is issuing will come out of RAM instead of going to the operating system. But be careful: is it really the solution? Does bufio.Reader really implement io.ReadSeeker and io.ReadAt like we need? (Spoiler: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t; maybe one of you readers would like to show us how to speed up Go\u0026rsquo;s tar using a replacement for bufio next advent season?)\nI hope you have enjoyed this little trip through the standard library and HTTP, taking a look at how to work together with the standard library in order to help it achieve more than it was was written to do, so that it can help you get your job done. When you implement io.Reader and friends, you get a chance to go behind the scenes of the libraries you are calling into, and feed them data from places their authors never expected!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2016/01/17/seeking-http/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eImagine there\u0026rsquo;s a giant ZIP file on a HTTP server, and you want to know what\u0026rsquo;s inside it.

I say eventually because though Switzerland is not immune from NIMBYism, our court system deals efficiently enough with oppositions so that if something is allowed by law (zoning laws, eco-protection laws, etc) then it does go through. The opposition (and there\u0026rsquo;s always opposition) does a few court challenges, it goes up a couple layers, sometimes to the supreme court, and the court rather quickly says, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s legal, shut up. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, change the laws, don\u0026rsquo;t come begging us to do so.\u0026rdquo;\nThe opposition have two complaints. They choose which one to talk about depending on the context. If they are going for \u0026ldquo;shock and awe\u0026rdquo; they use Photoshopped pictures to show how \u0026ldquo;ugly\u0026rdquo; the windmills will be. I\u0026rsquo;m suspicious of their Photoshopping, because though I think the relative sizes are correct, I don\u0026rsquo;t think the visibility (i.e. brightness of the windmills themselves and the reduction in visibility due to natural haze) in their pictures is correct. Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s true, they are giant industrial installations in areas previously used only for grazing and milking cows. But we should recall that raising and milking cows it itself a giant industrial operation with a twice-daily milk run with a diesel-powered truck through this scenic wonderland. Some of the milking barns even run off of polluting diesel generators\u0026hellip;\nIf you tell them, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t mind the windmills, they look like progress to me\u0026rdquo; (and I have!), then the opposition falls back onto their second line of defense. They say, \u0026ldquo;windmills do not produce energy when it is needed, so they can\u0026rsquo;t replace nuclear\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, first, that\u0026rsquo;s a straw-man. No one is talking about nuclear here; if we were we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t agree anyway because I\u0026rsquo;m pro-nuclear. I consider nuclear power to be green energy (and the founder of Greenpeace does as well). What I\u0026rsquo;m interested in is eliminating fossil fuels from electrical generation, and from transport use.\nThe Tesla battery technology for utilities is the missing part of the equation (update July 2017: I\u0026rsquo;ve just found out that Eaton, in my backyard at Le Lieu, make them too). They shift energy from the peak generation time to the time when the energy is needed, making it possible for windmills and solar to contribute to the baseline load that existing dirty electric plants provide. But they have so far been tested in giant, ugly, industrial installations, which even I would not like to see here in my backyard.\nSo that got me thinking about how the Mollendruz windmills could be hooked up to batteries.\nBatteries heat up when they are charged, and part of what\u0026rsquo;s special about Tesla\u0026rsquo;s innovations is to integrate cooling and fire protection into the heart of their battery packs. So a utility-scale battery installation will create utility-scale waste heat. In the current utility scale batteries, this is appears to be dumped into the atmosphere. But remote heating is a mature and well respected technology in Switzerland. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be interesting to put that waste heat to use heating our schools and government buildings?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how near batteries need to be to windmills to be efficient. Windmills generate alternating current, because they are a rotative power source. And AC travels at lower loss than DC. So it seems that putting the batteries where the heat is needed would be ok.\nBut the batteries are still ugly. What can we do about that? If you are harvesting the heat from them, and they are already engineered to be installed into moving cars and houses, the utility scale batteries can probably be installed indoors. In Switzerland, when we need to put things indoors and we want the land to remain pretty, we put them underground. Near the Col du Mollendruz there\u0026rsquo;s an old military fort called Petra Felix. I wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s enough room inside of it to hold the batteries?\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2015/07/31/industrial-scale-power-storage-and-waste-heat/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere will, eventually, be a \u003ca href=\"http://www.energienaturelle.ch/\"\u003egiant wind farm above my house\u003c/a\u003e.

I don\u0026rsquo;t mind abusing my colleagues, when I know I can take them out for lunch later and buy them a beer. Hassling random Golang Challenge entrants is not my style. But some have decided they are up for it, even if I\u0026rsquo;m remote and can\u0026rsquo;t buy them a beer afterwards.\nio.Toys\nFirst up, is Jason Clark. Jason\u0026rsquo;s entry is quite good, from an idiomatic Go point of view. He fell prey to the \u0026ldquo;under-testing\u0026rdquo; problem I mentioned, in that his entry does not handle message framing, or what happens if the buffer passed to Read is smaller than the incoming message. But what I\u0026rsquo;m really looking for for the purposes of this post are the WTF\u0026rsquo;s. And seeing io.TeeReader tipped me off that something interesting was about to happen:\n// Write encrypts the contents of p and writes it to the underlying io.Writer. func (w *SecureWriter) Write(p []byte) (int, error) { // Each message starts with a generated nonce. Only write the nonce once. if w.nonce == nil { var nonce [24]byte if _, err := io.ReadFull(io.TeeReader(rand.Reader, w.w), nonce[:]); err != nil { return 0, ErrNonceWrite } w.nonce = \u0026amp;nonce } // encrypted and send message _, err := w.w.Write(box.SealAfterPrecomputation(nil, p, w.nonce, w.key)) if err != nil { return 0, err } return len(p), nil } So, the first problem here is that this is just wrong. The docs for NaCl are clear that security is compromised if you use the same nonce for two different messages. But second, the use of io.TeeReader here is overly clever. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what io.TeeReader did, but the docs are clear enough: \u0026ldquo;TeeReader returns a Reader that writes to w what it reads from r\u0026rdquo;. So what that line does is get the nonce from cyrpto.Rand, and send the nonce down the unencrypted channel (correct!) while also sending it into nonce, to be saved for later as w.nonce (not correct!). To reason about that line as a reader you need to keep two unrelated processes in mind at once (saving the nonce for later, and sending it down now), and then ask yourself if the error handling correct in both of those cases.\nSo, if ErrNonceWrite is returned, was a nonce sent down the connection anyway? What was it?\nThe simpler way of doing this is in two steps. First read into a local called nonce, and check the errors on reading. Once you are sure you have a good nonce, send it down with w.Write(). Checking errors correctly here is critical, because if you don\u0026rsquo;t manage to get a new nonce, you must not send the message, since you might be sending it with a nonce of all zeros. The second time you\u0026rsquo;ve done this, you\u0026rsquo;ve compromised your security.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with using the nifty toys in the io package. And in fact, later in his submission, Jason uses io.MultiWriter in an interesting way. I can\u0026rsquo;t say that I\u0026rsquo;m personally 100% confident in the technique of using io.Copy to implement an echo server. I understand the theory, but it seems to me you become dependent on the right magic happening inside of io.Copy, instead of making sure that the logic of your program is front and center, where your reader can see it.\nAlways remember, code is for reading. When you work on a big system, with lots of coworkers, they will read and re-read your code for months and years after you\u0026rsquo;ve written it. Code is written once and read a thousand times. Make sure what\u0026rsquo;s there to read explains what you are doing and what you are depending on.\nAnd now for a random global problem\u0026hellip; Trevor Arjeski got in touch and asked if he had any WTFs. By chance, the first file I clicked on was secure_io.go, and within the first few lines I knew, \u0026ldquo;we have a winner!\u0026rdquo;\nIn a crypto system, the quality of your random numbers matters. This has been known by professional cryptographers for decades, and to the rest of us since 1996. So when I saw that Trevor was importing \u0026ldquo;math/rand\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;crypto/rand\u0026rdquo;, I knew that he had a big problem coming.\nWorse, I read down a few lines and saw the global \u0026ldquo;seeded\u0026rdquo;. The problem with this global is that access to it is not protected from a data race. There are three options for how to fix this:\nNuke it: This problem calls for using the \u0026ldquo;crypto/rand\u0026rdquo; package, which does not need seeding by the Go programmer.\nMove it to init: Lazy initialization, controlled by a global flag can sometimes be more simply moved to explicit initialization, before main starts running. Go guarantees that init functions are run in a single-threaded context (the spec says: \u0026ldquo;Package initialization—variable initialization and the invocation of init functions—happens in a single goroutine, sequentially, one package at a time.\u0026rdquo;)\nUse sync.Once to arrange for something to be lazily initialized once and only once.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve said before that good testing matters. But to catch this data race, Trevor should have written a test that concurrently created multiple SecureWriters and written into them. Then he would have had to run \u0026ldquo;go test -race\u0026rdquo;. It is wonderful that Go has the race detector, but it is better to never write data races to begin with. And a good way to not write them is to not allocate any shared data.\nGet in the habit of asking hard questions about every global you see: when it is initialized? Are there writes to it? How are they sequenced with respect to reads?\nWant some practice? Move on to lines 14 and 15\u0026hellip; :)\nAddicted to encoding/binary? Kristoffer Berdal got in touch and asked me to take a look. Kristoffer made a choice for readability that would eventually be a performance problem, if he wanted to benchmark and tune his implementation.\nIn his Writer we see a nice symmetrical list of calls to binary.Write. Reading through it, it makes the exact format of the protocol completely clear. So score points for self-documenting code!\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s a cost: check out the signature of binary.Write: func Write(w io.Writer, order ByteOrder, data interface{}) error\nThat means that each time we call into binary.Write, we\u0026rsquo;ll be doing a type conversion from the fundamental type of the third argument into an interface{}. This may involve an allocation, and once control gets inside of binary.Write, it will end up in the \u0026ldquo;fall back onto reflection\u0026rdquo; code path, because the nonce and (usually) the message are not less than 8 bytes long. Reflection is powerful and magical, and a strong point of Go. But it is not fast, when the alternative is not using reflection.\nA better choice for writing the nonce and the message, which are simple []byte types, would have been to use the Write method of the underlying io.Writer. (Also, this saves the reader of puzzling over what the meaning of the little endian representation of a [24]byte is\u0026hellip;)\nOne thing that\u0026rsquo;s interesting about Go is that it can be highly friendly and easy like Python, or highly precise and speedy like C. Choosing when to do one or the other (or finding a way to do both) is the trick that requires experience. It is always important to first get it right, then get it clear, then measure, and only if measurement says to do so, make it fast. In a case like this, Kristoffer has written it right, and clearly. But by turning to a function that uses interface{} where there was another option, he left some performance on the table. Worse, he might have left behind a trap that a colleague will need to deal with later when the prototype goes to production and starts handling gigbits of data per second.\nThanks\nThanks to those who gave me permission to pick on them. I hope that they\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed the 15 minutes of fame, and that we\u0026rsquo;ve all learned something useful.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2015/04/24/doing-it-the-hard-way/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my \u003ca href=\"/golang-challenge-2-comments/\"\u003elast post\u003c/a\u003e I offered to point out some things in Golang Challenge #2 submissions that struck me as \u0026ldquo;worthy of receiving a (polite) rebuke in code review\u0026rdquo;, otherwise known as WTFs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is opt-in abuse.

The organizer, Satish, asked me to write up my thoughts.\nThe main similarity I noticed in the entries was not enough testing. The vast majority of the entries used the tests provided in with the challenge unmodified. Taking the given tests without thinking critically about them lead people to make a number of critical mistakes, over and over again. The majority of the entries I graded passed the tests, but would not have stood up to production use. Of the 40 I graded, only 2 or 3 would have received a \u0026ldquo;ship it\u0026rdquo; from me in my day job. Those were (not by chance) the ones with extra tests beyond the ones provided in the challenge.\nA key part of growing into a mature programmer is to understand that the problem as it arrives in your \u0026ldquo;todo basket\u0026rdquo; is rarely correctly specified. This challenge is no exception. The challenge asked participants to \u0026ldquo;make the given tests pass\u0026rdquo;, but didn\u0026rsquo;t mention if you could or should write extra tests. The bottom line is that you can always write extra tests, and by doing so, you will discover where the spec is weak, or wrong. You will also decide for yourself where the \u0026ldquo;edge\u0026rdquo; of the task is; thinking about tests you can and should write will help fix the size of the job at hand.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m describing here is test-driven development. Go\u0026rsquo;s tools make it easy to stay on the golden path of TDD, you just need to decide that you believe in its benefits, and then teach yourself the discipline to do it. In TDD, the tests push the implementation away from the hacky thing that seems to work towards the robust thing that actually does work, that lives alongside of proof that it works (the tests) and that will keep working even as the world changes around it (because you\u0026rsquo;ll fix the code when the tests start failing).\nTwo deficiencies in the given tests were that they did not test legitimate network behaviors like short reads, and they gave the impression that the protocol should be one-shot (i.e. set up a TCP connection, exchange public keys, echo one message and close). Given that the problem statement asked for an io.Reader and and io.Writer that encrypted data, it stands to reason that a good solution would be able to handle more than one message, since io.Reader/io.Writer are not one-shot interfaces.\nA common problem in TCP servers is short reads. Just because the sender put 1000 bytes into the TCP stream via one write system call does not mean you are guaranteed to receive those same 1000 bytes in a matching read call. To get that behavior, you\u0026rsquo;d need a reliable transaction protocol like SCTP. With TCP, all you are guaranteed is that the same bytes will arrive at the far end, in the same order.\nTo see where a short read can come from, we need to look at it one packet at a time. Imagine what happens if the sender gives the kernel 2000 bytes, then sleeps on a the read of a reply. If the MTU on the link is 1500 bytes, the TCP implementation might send out one packet with about 1500 bytes in it, and a second with 500 (the \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; is hand waving for the TCP/IP overhead we\u0026rsquo;re ignoring here). Now imagine that the second packet is lost, and the replacement is lost as well. On the third try it gets through. On the receiving end, what we see is 1000 bytes which arrive, followed by a pause and 500 more. If the pause is long enough, the kernel will decide to stop making the application wait around for the first 1000 bytes and pass them up. The reader, blocked in the recv() system call, will get unblocked and receive the 1000 bytes. The next time it blocks on recv(), it will get the enxt 500 bytes. This is one of many explanations for how you can get a short read. There\u0026rsquo;s no guarantees, and code that expects there to be is wrong and will fail in real life (but not in your fast, non-lossy, testing environment; in particular, if you test via localhost, you\u0026rsquo;re very unlikely to ever see short reads).\nBut short reads could some from someplace much simpler\u0026hellip; from the tests. Consider how your challenge entry would have behaved if it was reading from an io.Reader that intentionally returned only one byte at a time.\nGiven the reality of short reads, it is up to the application to handle framing the bytes into messages. The majority of entries did not take this into consideration. The solution is that each message needs to be sent with it\u0026rsquo;s length. And when SecureReader reads from the underlying io.Reader, it needs to use something like ioutil.ReadAll to make certain all the bytes arrive, no matter how many calls to the underlying io.Reader it takes to get them all. But then that opens up the question of what to do when the connection hangs? Do you timeout? How can you cause ioutil.ReadAll to return early?\nIn Go, different pieces of the language and the standard library can be composed to make something better than any of them alone. A great way to read frames from the network is to prepend the frame with it\u0026rsquo;s length. You read the length using encoding/binary.Read, make an io.LimitedReader which is limited to the length, then give that LimitedReader to ioutil.ReadAll. You can handle timeouts by checking that if the underlying io.Reader satisfies an interface with SetReadDeadline in it (as the various connection types in package net do), and then using it to set a deadline. After the deadline passes, the underlying io.Reader will return a timeout error, which the LimitedReader will return to ioutil.ReadAll, which will cause it to return early, telling you that the read timed out.\nThe other thing I noticed is that even in a language designed for simplicity, there are a myriad of ways to do things too difficultly in Go. In other words, go is not WTF-proof. *\nThe only solution to this problem is that you need to read lots and lots of code (way, way more than your write!). Read the highest quality code you can find. Code from the Go core team is a very good choice (the standard library itself and side projects by Andrew, Russ, and Brad). You can also read the reviews of potential new code for the Go core (read the golang-dev mailing list to find out where the reviews are). By watching other people get their screw ups corrected, you can avoid making them in the first place! It is much easier on the ego too, to watch other people get corrected for a mistake you would have made. :)\n\\* In order to not single people out here in public I\u0026rsquo;m not going to talk about the specific WTF\u0026rsquo;s I saw. But if you\u0026rsquo;d be willing to have your code publicly mocked by me, drop me a line with a pointer to your challenge solution. If there\u0026rsquo;s a WTF in there, I\u0026rsquo;ll post about it and you\u0026rsquo;ll be infamous, and we can all have a good laugh\u0026hellip; :)\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2015/04/23/golang-challenge-2-comments/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve just finished evaluating 40 of the 105 entries to the \u003ca href=\"http://golang-challenge.com/go-challenge2/\"\u003eGolang Challenge #2\u003c/a\u003e.

But then you think, \u0026ldquo;oh, what a drag, I gotta compare two []byte values for equality, and == doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on them\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd then you think, \u0026ldquo;oh, I\u0026rsquo;ll use reflection!\u0026rdquo; And now you have two problems.\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;crypto/sha256\u0026#34; \u0026#34;encoding/hex\u0026#34; \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) func main() { in := []byte(\u0026#34;a test string\u0026#34;) hashHex := \u0026#34;b830543dc5d1466110538736d35c37cc61d32076a69de65c42913dfbb1961f46\u0026#34; hash1, _ := hex.DecodeString(hashHex) hash2 := sha256.Sum256(in) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;equal?\u0026#34;, reflect.DeepEqual(hash1, hash2)) } The code on play.golang.org.\nWhen you run that, you find out that even though the hash is most assuredly right, reflect.DeepEqual returns \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve just written this as new code, in the context of some other new code that gets and parses the hash, you might not go looking at that reflect.DeepEqual until you\u0026rsquo;ve checked and rechecked everything else. And by then you\u0026rsquo;ll be really annoyed.\nYou, the reader of this blog, can probably tell you\u0026rsquo;re being set up by now. And you are.\nThe thing about the reflect package is that it is all about runtime type checking. And the thing about runtime is that it happens later, when you, the programmer, and the compiler are not available to apply your respective unique talents. So bad things can happen, and the compiler can\u0026rsquo;t save you (and it goes without saying that you can\u0026rsquo;t save yourself, because you are a fallible human).\nIt turns out the type of hash2 is not []byte as I lead you to think. Go read the docs and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that it\u0026rsquo;s type is [32]byte.\nWhile you are in the docs, you might notice bytes.Compare. It is the solution to our problem. Because it uses static types instead of interface{} like the reflect package, the compiler is going to be able to help you use it correctly. And when you try to use it:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;bytes\u0026#34; \u0026#34;crypto/sha256\u0026#34; \u0026#34;encoding/hex\u0026#34; \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) func main() { in := []byte(\u0026#34;a test string\u0026#34;) hashHex := \u0026#34;b830543dc5d1466110538736d35c37cc61d32076a69de65c42913dfbb1961f46\u0026#34; hash1, _ := hex.DecodeString(hashHex) hash2 := sha256.Sum256(in) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;equal?\u0026#34;, reflect.DeepEqual(hash1, hash2)) fmt.Println(\u0026#34;equal?\u0026#34;, bytes.Compare(hash1, hash2) == 0) } The code on play.golang.org.\nThis gives the helpful error message cannot use hash2 (type [32]byte) as type []byte in argument to bytes.Compare. Which, at a stroke, explains why reflect.DeepEqual is screwing up: the first check it is making is \u0026ldquo;are these the same type?\u0026rdquo; And the answer is no, so hash1 and hash2 are not equal. Even though they are.\nIn order to turn hash2 into a []byte so that it can be the second argument to bytes.Compare, you just need to take a full slice of it, changing it to hash2[:].\nThe final, working, hash compare is here.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2015/02/16/type-safety-saves-the-day-again/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, I was writing some code to check the SHA256 of a buffer.

And that resource exists in both HTTP and HTTPS versions? Then you need to give a hostname and path (because it is no longer relative to your hostname), but not a scheme (so that the scheme is relative to the context where the relative URL is found).\nSuch beasts exist.

The last few days I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on a new home hacking project. The eventual plan is to create a panoramic time-lapse of sunrise as seen from my house each morning. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a wonderful view, and recording some of those beautiful morning colors as the sun comes up over the Alps should make them easier to appreciate \u0026ndash; without setting my alarm for 6 AM!\nWe have little windows in our attic that look out over the view. And being so high up in the house, they have a commanding view over the trees in front of our house. So I knew I needed my camera mounted up there. That location, in turn, fixed some other variables. There\u0026rsquo;s power up there, but no ethernet, so the camera needs to be on wifi. (Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m kicking myself. I\u0026rsquo;m an idiot for not specifying an ethernet run up to there. But the good news is there\u0026rsquo;s a closet where I can run it, so doing it myself will be quick and easy.)\nI got a camera for my Raspberry Pi. I\u0026rsquo;ve had bad experiences in the past with webcams due to cheap lenses. So when I saw a camera module with a CS mount lens included, I went for it. The specs of the Raspberry Pi camera are incredible. The fact that it is on a high speed bus direclty attached to the GPU is very interesting. It means that the GPU can accelerate video compression. So the little Raspberry Pi can still manage to stream 1080p video!\nIn fact, once I had it hooked up and mounted up in the window, I needed to focus it. I found some instructions on how to stream video from it. They worked flawlessly. Using VLC to watch the camera\u0026rsquo;s output, I got it aimed and focused. I loved having the stream so much, I left it running. Paste this URL into VLC to see the stream: http://pi.nella.org:8554 (IPv6 only; and it\u0026rsquo;s not up anymore anyway)\nVideo streaming only works over IPv6, because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to fuss around with IPv4 NAT traversal settings. NATs are stupid; IPv6 is the answer. And IPv6 is getting easier and easier\u0026hellip;\nAs for the time-lapses, I used Go to write a little program to that uses a library to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset (thank you Github user keep94!).

After reading the spec and finding this package that handles reading and writing the messages themselves, I decided to write a server.\nThe result is here: https://github.com/jeffallen/mqtt.\nAfter I finished, I wanted to know if my server was comparable to Mosquitto, so I wrote some load testing tools. I found that my Go server was generally comparable to Mosquitto, in that it had the same order of magnitude for transaction rate and latency (but it was strictly slower than Mosquitto; there is a cost to pay for the benefits Go gives you). As usual, Go programs compare quite favorably to C programs in terms of memory safety, overall length, and readability. It is also useful to consider that my implementation took only a couple of days to get finished. A C program with equivalent safety, correctness, and speed would take much longer to write. I\u0026rsquo;ve written them, I know.\nThen I mentioned to my coworker Atila what I\u0026rsquo;d done. Knowing that Atila is incredibly competitive and a total D fanatic (and Go refusnik) I might have casually implied that D would have a hard time competing with my incredibly short, fast, correct, and beautiful Go version. Heh heh heh.\nFORE!\nAnd so the code golf began. It only ended yesterday when Atila came back to me and begged me not to write any more benchmarks because he was tired of beating my sorry ass into the ground with his blazing fast D implementation. Fair \u0026rsquo;nuff.\nIf I still have your attention\u0026hellip;\nHere are some interesting things from the experience and the code I wanted to point out.\nIt is often said that the solution to a problem in a domain specific language will be shorter and more correct than the solution in a general purpose language. Of course, the drawback is that you\u0026rsquo;ve got to write the DSL first, and then people who come along after you have to learn it. Implementing an MQTT server in Go really felt like writing in the correct domain specific language. It basically wrote itself, because channels and garbage collection meant that the hardest parts of a message passing server happen in the runtime instead of in the code.\nThough Atila had a huge amount of fun tuning his D implementation, I didn\u0026rsquo;t do much at all to tune my implementation.\nI used \u0026ldquo;go tool pprof\u0026rdquo; to fetch a CPU profile from it while it was under load from the pingtest program. But the resulting trace showed that it was spending most of its time jumping on and off of system threads. In other words the program is I/O bound, not CPU bound. It is making \u0026ldquo;too many\u0026rdquo; kernel calls, and thus speeding it up by looking for a hot spot or reducing garbage collection overhead isn\u0026rsquo;t interesting. The solution would have been to add some kind of buffering layer between the net.Conn and the message encoder/decoder. But the problem with an intervention like that is that you\u0026rsquo;d need to do it carefully so that the buffer would cut down on kernel/user context switches while there were very high transaction rates, but not introduce latency on messages when the transaction rate is low. And if the goal is massive scalability, with 1 million or more connections, each of which have a very low transaction rate, then this buffering technique wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help anything.\nI did notice one nice optimization I was able to make when I was looking at the traffic with Wireshark. It is documented in this checkin. The lesson here is fewer calls to the kernel is not only a good idea for kernel/user context switch time, but may also save a significant amount of bandwidth.\nAs for Go techniques, I created something called a \u0026ldquo;receipt\u0026rdquo;, which lets you get synchronous feedback about a job sent in via a asynchronous mechanism. Take a look at how submitSync is used when we need to know when a certain message has departed. A receipt is a channel. The only two operations done on the channel are \u0026ldquo;make\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;close\u0026rdquo;. This makes it work like a condition variable. It flowed out of my fingers at the time; I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it is an idiom I\u0026rsquo;ll use again. It certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t give me any problems, so I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll keep it!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know or care where this code will go. If I receive pull requests, I\u0026rsquo;ll act on them. If someone needs to depend on this for a production-quality system, they might want to fork it and take long-term ownership of it. That\u0026rsquo;s OK with me too.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2013/12/05/mqtt-code-golf/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA while ago at work, I needed to learn a little about MQTT.

They drove up up up to the top of Lausanne and then up up up to Mont sur Lausanne, then up up up more to the little self-service vegetable stand above it.

But each night, when the little red robot went into sleep mode, something magical happened. He got to do things he never did in the day. He ran programs for flying on clouds, climbing in trees, (around this point Elio interrupted and asked that the story should include a \u0026ldquo;motoschlitta\u0026rdquo;: snowmobile), and ride lunar snowmobiles across the moon through craters and over the horizon, far from the robot base. That night, the little red robot ran the snow mobile program in his processing unit all night.

My wife and I both love good story telling. She even took a course on it once, and told a story to an audience as the final project. We go to le Nuit des Contes every year here in Lausanne, and I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up some tips from watching the (literally) professionals there. A key to oral story telling, certainly for small children, is to use a structure with repeating sounds and phrases that they can get wrapped up in.\nIn order to have these some day to look back at, I\u0026rsquo;m going to start writing down summaries of stories I tell. If one is good enough to develop and retell, perhaps one day I\u0026rsquo;ll tell it at the Nuit des contes!\nOur 1974 VW Type 2 camper van (\u0026ldquo;Bep\u0026rdquo; is his name) would be the star of every story if Elio got to choose. Instead, we offer him a choice of three characters and then go from there. The key, I find, is to start slowly, describing the character, throwing in some fun details right away. This gives you time to race ahead in your mind and choose a rough storyline. The easiest is to choose the end state first, so you know where you are trying to get to. Then, like a dot to dot painting, you need to fill in a few intermediate hops along the way. These are attempts the character makes at achieving the goal, or increasingly dire straights the character finds himself in. These stretch out the story, but more importantly, give it a verse/chorus/verse/chorus/verse structure, which is where the real magic comes from. And the rhythm necessary to put aÂ fidgety 2-year oldÂ kid to sleep, as well, which is the point afterall!\nWhat do I mean by verse/chorus? The chorus is the catch-phrase, the repeated element that signals another loop around. It gives the story rhythm and momentum. The verses carry the story forward, so that you get to where you are trying to go and you get that nice satisfying conclusion.\nSo here are several stories that I\u0026rsquo;ve told so far:\nBep and the Doubting Family: A story from real life, about a little camper that joined a new family and though it had been crossing the passes of Switzerland all its life, the mom and dad were worried it couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it (a family version of the Little Engine that Could). For each pass: Daddy said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he can make it\u0026rdquo;, and Mommy said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid he can\u0026rsquo;t make it!\u0026rdquo;, and Elio said, \u0026ldquo;Go Bep, Go!\u0026rdquo;, and Bep said, \u0026ldquo;beep beep, vroom vroom, I know I can make it\u0026hellip; I know I can make it\u0026hellip; I knew I could make it!\u0026rdquo;. Bep and the Big Campers: Big campers at a campground are making fun of Bep (\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s only got 4 cylinders!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;No fuel injection!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;He doesn\u0026rsquo;t even run on diesel!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s got no toilet!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;His exhaust stinks: che sputzza di benzina!\u0026rdquo;). Bep says he\u0026rsquo;s as good as other campers, but they demand proof. He names all the passes he\u0026rsquo;s done, and the bigger campers say, \u0026ldquo;Wait, they let you do that pass? I\u0026rsquo;m not allowed on it because I\u0026rsquo;m too big!\u0026rdquo;. The Dutch camper says, \u0026ldquo;My owners drive me all night long on the autoroute here, and go through all the tunnels to save time!\u0026rdquo;. The big-ass bus starts crying because he\u0026rsquo;ll never get to seeÂ Passo del Lucomagno because he\u0026rsquo;s too long. Bep makes him feel better by reminding him that he can drive all night from Barcelona and his owners don\u0026rsquo;t even have to go pee at the gas station. All the campers are friends after that. Bunny and the Giant Carrot. A little bunny tells her mom that she loves carrots. She loves them so much she wants to grow up and be a farmer and grow carrots. She\u0026rsquo;ll sell them all around the forest. She\u0026rsquo;ll sell them by the big rock, and past the oak tree, etc, etc, etc. (This was inspired by Elio\u0026rsquo;s cousin, who told us this summer of a plan to be a farmer and sell his produce all around Switzerland in order to get out and see the country. Good plan, if you ask me!) She tells her mother the same thing every night, each night adding one more place she\u0026rsquo;ll sell her carrots, and naming all the others. One night, her mother reminds her that tomorrow is a special day, her birthday. She receives a single carrot seed, but it\u0026rsquo;s magic. The next morning, she has a regular carrot in her plot. But her mom convinces her to wait another night (and another and another, as many as it takes to make your fidgity 2 year old tired). Then it goes to seed and gives her all the seeds she\u0026rsquo;ll need to achieve her dream of being a carrot farmer. Bep and the Apple. On a long trip, the daddy stops the car at a fruit stand. (Based on real life, and my fond memories of driving from San Francisco to Arnold as a child). He buys an apple for everyone (mommy, daddy, Elio and Emma). Each person crunches their apple, except Emma who coos because she knows she\u0026rsquo;ll get her apple cooked for snacktime later. Bep complains that he didn\u0026rsquo;t get an apple, and daddy explains to Bep that he can\u0026rsquo;t eat them, Bep eats gas. But daddy promises to make it up to Bep by getting him an apple anyway. Bep goes su, su, su! the pass, turning left and right and left and right and a moto goes by and goes zoom! (Repeat for as many switchbacks and/or passes as necessary until kidlet is cuddling and knodding off.) Bep is running out of gas and worried that daddy won\u0026rsquo;t fill him in time. But just when he\u0026rsquo;s sure he can\u0026rsquo;t go another kilometer, around the corner comes a giant sign with an apple on top. It\u0026rsquo;s Apple Gas, where Bep gets his gas, just as daddy promised! The Lonely King. The king of a country with one citizen (the king himself) is lonely. On the plus side, all his subjects follow his orders, but having more people to play with would be nice. So he tries everything he can think of to get more citizens. He plants flowers on his castle, but the tourists just take pictures. He makes a decree that all the women of the kingdom (i.e. zero) must marry him, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because there are none and because women don\u0026rsquo;t like to be told what to do like that anyway. He tries giving away cookies, but he runs out and no one moves in anyway. One day, a nice lady goes out picking mushrooms. She goes up up up the mountain until she finds herself in the kingdom. She asks the king if he\u0026rsquo;d like to look for mushrooms with her, and they laugh and have fun until sunset. She comes back for more mushrooms, day after day. After two weeks, the are in love. After two months, they are married. After two years, they have a family. And when the king and his queen had a happy family in the kingdom, other people came to join the happy kingdom and the king was no longer lonely (though he was likely exhausted from staying up late into the night telling stories to his kids).

The trick is to unset close-on-exec on the listen socket, then fork/exec a new copy of the server (on the upgraded binary) with an argument to tell it to use the inherited file descriptor instead of calling socket() and listen(s).\nI wanted to see if I could achieve the same thing with Go, and what changes would be necessary to the standard libraries to make this possible. I got it working, without changing the standard library, so I wanted to explain what I did here.\nThe code for this post is here.\nThere are several interesting things I\u0026rsquo;d like to point out in this program. Twice, I used the pattern of \u0026ldquo;implement an interface in order to intercept method calls\u0026rdquo;. This is an important pattern in Go that I don\u0026rsquo;t think is widely understood and documented.\nWhen I started thinking about this job I knew one of my problems would be to dig down inside of http.(*Server).Serve in order to get it to stop calling Accept() when the old server should shutdown gracefully. The problem is that there\u0026rsquo;s no hooks in there; the only way out of the loop (\u0026ldquo;accept, start go routine to process, do it again\u0026rdquo;) is for Accept to return an error. But if you think of Accept as a system call, you might think, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t get in there and inject an error\u0026rdquo;. But Accept() is not a system call: it\u0026rsquo;s a method in the interface net.Listener. Which means that if you make your own object which satisfies net.Listener, you can pass that in to http.(*Server).Serve and do what you want in Accept().\nThe first time I read about embedding types in structures I got lost and confused. And when I tried it, I had pointers in the mix and I had lots of unexplained nil pointer errors. This time, I read it again and it made sense. Type embedding is essential when you want to interpose one of the methods of an interface. It lets you inherit all the implementations of the underlying object except for the one that you redefine. Take a look at stoppableListener in upgradable.go. The net.Listener interface requires three methods including Accept, Close, and Addr. But I only defined one of those, Accept(). How is it that stoppableListener still implements net.Listener? Because the other two methods \u0026ldquo;show through\u0026rdquo; from where they were embedded in it. Only Accept() has a more precise definition. When I wrote Accept(), then I needed to figure out how to talk to the underlying object, in order to pass on the Accept() call. The trick here is to understand that embedding a type creates a new field in your structure with the unqualified name of the type. So I can refer to the net.Listener inside of stoppableListener sl as sl.Listener, and I can call the underlying Accept() as sl.Listener.Accept().\nNext I started wondering how to handle the \u0026ldquo;stopped\u0026rdquo; error code from Serve(). Immediately exiting with os.Exit(0) isn\u0026rsquo;t right, because there can still be go routines servicing HTTP clients. We need some way to know when each client is done. Interposition to the rescue again, since we can wrap up the net.Conn returned by Accept() and use it to decrement a count of the number of currently running connections. This technique of interposing the net.Conn object could have other interesting uses. For example, by trapping the Read() or Write() calls, you could enforce rate limiting on the connection, without needing the protocol implementation to know anything about it. You could even do other zany things like implement opportunistic encryption, again without the protocol knowing it was happening.\nOnce I knew that I would be able to stop my server gracefully, I needed to figure out how to start the new one on the correct file descriptor. Rog Peppe pointed me to the net.FileListener object, which one can construct from an *os.File (which you can make from a raw file descriptor in an int using os.NewFile).\nThe final problem is that net always sets the close-on-exec flag on file descriptors for sockets it opens. So I needed to turn that off on the listen socket, so that the file descriptor would still be valid in the new process. Unfortunately syscall.CloseOnExec does not take a boolean to tell it what you want (do close or don\u0026rsquo;t close). So instead, I pulled out the stuff from syscall that I needed and put it directly in upgradable.go. Not pretty, but nicer than hacking the standard library. (This is a nice thing about Go: there\u0026rsquo;s almost always a way to do what you want, even if you have to hack around just a bit.)\nI tested that it works manually (using command-line GETs from another window). I also tested it under load using http_load. It is really cool to be able to set up a load test for 20 seconds and get 3937 fetches/sec, then do the test again, adding in a few \u0026ldquo;GET http://localhost:8000/upgrade\u0026rdquo; from another window and still getting 3880 fetches/sec, even as I replaced the running binary a few times during the load test!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2012/05/29/zero-downtime-upgrades-of-tcp-servers-in-go/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA recent post on the golang-nuts mailing list mentioned that Nginx can upgrade on the fly without ever stopping listening to it\u0026rsquo;s listen socket.

I decided to send the same header into Go\u0026rsquo;s range header parser and see what happened. It passed with flying colors, giving the \u0026ldquo;invalid range\u0026rdquo; error, which would result in the Go webserver sending back HTTP response code 416 to the HTTP client.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t test this under load (which is part of what the DoS was doing), but my quick reading of parseRange leads me to believe that the only effect of sending Range headers in like this is that garbage is created under control of the attacker (for example, due to strings.Split(s[len(b):], \u0026ldquo;,\u0026rdquo;)). Of course, that\u0026rsquo;s bad and should be limited. However, this risk is no greater than other places in the server. For example an attacker could send an unlimited number of headers, or headers of unlimited length. This is already mentioned in the net/textproto package\u0026rsquo;s reader.go.\nI did notice something strange while looking into this, which is that there\u0026rsquo;s a constant named maxHeaderLines (1024) that is never referenced. This is probably because the (incorrectly non-plurally-named) textproto.ReadMIMEHead er is now in charge of reading all the headers, but it does not accept a max headers parameter.\nThe fact that this particular constructed header causes no problem is no great surprise, because this attack was highly targeted at Apache.

I\u0026rsquo;m leaving it here because it is still interesting, even if out of date.\nGo uses split stacks (also called segmented stacks in the literature) in order to allow thousands of stacks in the space that would normally be taken by hundreds of C-style contiguous stacks. There\u0026rsquo;s a discussion of how to add split stacks to GCC here. Note: it was written by the author of gccgo, around the time he started porting Go to Gcc, so it\u0026rsquo;s clear that he\u0026rsquo;s adding split stacks to Gcc to help Go. But if it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to C programmers as well, then so much the better!\nIan\u0026rsquo;s article is dedicated to how he planned to add split stacks to GCC. I want to dig down to the lowest level and trace every single step of the process of maintaining split stacks in the native Go runtime. I hope you, dear reader, do too. Here we go\u0026hellip;\nFirst, we need a program that\u0026rsquo;s going to use up all it\u0026rsquo;s stack. Since the point of this article is not to learn about Go\u0026rsquo;s stack-based object allocation we\u0026rsquo;ll use up the stack with return addresses, specifically to main:\npackage main func main() { main() } Now, don\u0026rsquo;t go running that just yet, or else you\u0026rsquo;ll have the out of memory killer on your back. Instead, go run that under gdb, setting a breakpoint on runtime.morestack:\n$ gdb 8.out (gdb) b runtime.morestack Breakpoint 1 at 0x80494de: file /home/jra/go/src/pkg/runtime/386/asm.s, line 150.

First, why did morestack get called? Because we are out of stack space. But how did we know? Ian\u0026rsquo;s explanation of split stacks lays this out pretty well: on the entry into every subroutine, we need to check how much space is left, and if it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;not enough\u0026rdquo;, get a new stack to run on.\nWhen you take a look at the assembly listing for main as it leaves 8g, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to see:\n$ 8g -S stack.go | head -10 --- prog list \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; --- 0000 (stack.go:3) TEXT main+0(SB),$0-0 0001 (stack.go:4) CALL ,main+0(SB) 0002 (stack.go:5) RET , But when you take a look at the assembly listing for main generated by 8l, you see something else:\n$ 8l -a stack.8 | head -8 codeblk [0x8048c00,0x805332a) at offset 0xc00 8048c00\tmain.main | (3)\tTEXT\tmain.main+0(SB),$0 8048c00\t658b0d00000000 | (3)\tMOVL\t(GS),CX 8048c07\t8b49f8 | (3)\tMOVL\t-8(CX),CX 8048c0a\t3b21 | (3)\tCMPL\tSP,(CX) 8048c0c\t7709 | (3)\tJHI\t,8048c17 8048c0e\t31d2 | (3)\tMOVL\t$0,DX 8048c10\t31c0 | (3)\tMOVL\t$0,AX 8048c12\te8c7080000 | (3)\tCALL\t,80494de+runtime.morestack 8048c17\te8e4ffffff | (4)\tCALL\t,8048c00+main.main 8048c1c\tc3 | (5)\tRET\t, So already we\u0026rsquo;ve found something interesting, which is that part of split stacks is implemented in the linker, not in the compiler. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why this is, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably another nice example of Broken Abstractions in Go.\nAnd what\u0026rsquo;s that code doing? It says, \u0026ldquo;find the current goroutine\u0026rsquo;s struct G, and compare the current stack pointer to g.stackguard\u0026rdquo;. In the Go runtime (Linux, x86), the GS segment register points to a segment descriptor table entry which was set using modify_ldt(2). The segment descriptor arranges that references like 0(GS) refer to the base of the struct Gobuf, which in turn has a pointer to the current struct G for the goroutine. The comparison is checking to see if we are about to run off the end of the stack. But what are the actual contents of these things? Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look, with a newly started copy of the program:\n$ gdb 8.out (gdb) b main.main Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048c00: file /home/jra/go-stuff/stack.go, line 3.

This time through, we are not going to end up in runtime.morestack because the current stack pointer (0xb7dc50d4) is greater than the stack guard (0xb7dc4100).\nAnd how far above the end of the stack is the stack guard? This is explained in a giant comment in runtime.h, at least giant for the Go team\u0026rsquo;s standards, which is \u0026ldquo;less is better, even for comments\u0026rdquo;. :) We can take a look at it for ourselves as well. According to the definition of struct G, the stack base is the next pointer down from the stackguard:\n(gdb) x 0xb7dc3004 \u0026lt;-- cx + 4 0xb7dc3004:\t0xb7dc50dc \u0026lt;-- the stack base Now, stack base in this context is \u0026ldquo;the place where the stack starts growing down from\u0026rdquo;. So we have the following interesting places:\n0xb7dc50dc: stack base 0xb7dc50d4: current stack pointer 0xb7dc4100: stack guard 0xb7dc4000: end of the stack (see the constant StackGuard defined in runtime.h) If we fast forward a few thousand iterations of main, the current stack pointer is going to move down, one return address at a time, until the current stack pointer is less than the stack guard. At that point, we know we need more stack. We still have 128 bytes to work with, but some routines in the Go runtime can\u0026rsquo;t or don\u0026rsquo;t want to check for stack underflow, so we set the stack guard high enough to leave room for them to run. On Windows, the user-space exception handler could always get called, so the stack guard is much higher (2048 bytes) to leave room for it to work, since we don\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to hook it and teach it about split stacks.\nAs an aside, when you are reading the sources and you see \u0026ldquo;#pragma textflag 7\u0026rdquo; or when you see an assembly routine that starts like \u0026ldquo;TEXT runtimeÂ·exit(SB),7,$0\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s a routine that will not be checking for possible stack underflow. So it, and any sub-calls, had better require a maximum of 128 bytes of stack. This \u0026ldquo;7 flag\u0026rdquo; is a note from the compiler (via the assembler) to the linker asking it to refrain from adding the stack underflow check.\nTo take a look at the next step of the process, we need to turn our attention to morestack, which is found in runtime/386/asm.s. Things get complicated here, but there\u0026rsquo;s two steps that are important for our investigation: first, morestack puts some information away in the current struct M so that it can use it later including the size of the current stack frame and argument list of the current function call and the return address of the caller of the function that just got pre-empted. It is going to need this information to link the new stack to the old one.\nNote that morestack is in runtime/386/asm.s. It is processor-dependent, because it is grabbing stuff off the stack in a processor-dependent way. But it is not OS-dependent, which is interesting. On the other hand, the code that sets the segment registers (mentioned above) is OS dependent, because changing the global descriptor table requires ring-0 privileges.\nWhen morestack has saved away what it needs, it changes stacks to the scheduler\u0026rsquo;s stack, and then transfers control to runtime.newstack. Allocating a new stack is a sizeable chunk of work, because stacks are allocated using exactly the same mechanism as any other piece of memory allocated by the Go runtime. So we need to make sure we have a full stack available for runtime.mallocgc to run on. Note that morestack leaves via a CALL, but kills itself if it returns, because it knows that newstack is going to retun in a funky way (keep reading\u0026hellip;). We\u0026rsquo;ll have to remember to take a look at newstack to find out how the return address pushed by CALL gets cleaned up.\nNewstack has some complexity related to reflection, so before we start let\u0026rsquo;s just agree to ignore that ok? We\u0026rsquo;ll come back to reflection low-level details some other day. Once we ignore the reflection stuff, newstack ends up relatively simple: allocate a new range of memory, decorate the top of it with something called a \u0026ldquo;struct Stktop\u0026rdquo;, then exit in a funky way.\nThe allocation step is fairly straightforward: calculate the size of the new stack, then . The size calculation is a bit interesting: the new stack will be the maximum of StackBig or of the amount of space needed by this function. StackBig is 4096 (8192 on Windows, see the comments for why). So if you\u0026rsquo;ve got one function in a call-chain that wants more stack space than the stack currently has, and even more than the stack is normally extended, it will get a stack of it\u0026rsquo;s own, and then when it calls another function, it may cause a second trip through morestack. Some magic happens inside of stackalloc to decide if it is currently safe to allocate a new stack with mallocgc, or if the new stack should come from a fixed-size allocator instead. Also, since the most commonly used stack is StackBig + StackExtra bytes long, there\u0026rsquo;s a shurtcut to avoid the heavier mallocgc route for that as well. So while the shorthand explanation of split stacks is that it is a technique to make stacks as easy to deal with as garbage collected objects, it\u0026rsquo;s not true that all stacks come directly from and go back into, the garbage collected pool.\nOnce the new stack is allocated, newstack \u0026ldquo;decorates\u0026rdquo; the top of it. It fills in a struct Stktop with information that will be used later when we are cleaning up the stack and transferring stacks from this one back to the last one. Next, newstack moves the frame and the arguments from the call that was preempted onto the new stack. With that we are ready to put the new stack to use.\nThis is where the funky exit comes. newstack uses gogocall, which is basically how the Go scheduler implements context switches. It switches onto the new stack and then arranges that the next RET that we hit (i.e. the RET at the end of the function that was preempted) will result in a jump to a certain function, called runtime.lessstack. gogocall exits with a JMP to the preempted function, so as not to mess up the stack it\u0026rsquo;s just put in order, and the preempted function starts running again on it\u0026rsquo;s new stack!\nlessstack, as the name implies, is the counterpart to morestack. It runs in the context of the old stack, but its job is to save things and prepare for the call to oldstack (the counterpart to newstack). It needs to save the return value, then switch onto the scheduling stack, for the same reason that morestack needed to. oldstack, as the counterpart to newstack does what you\u0026rsquo;d expect: it gets us off of the current stack (freeing it) and starts executing on the old stack. We need to carry two pieces of state from the returning function, the return value (in AX) and the \u0026ldquo;return arguments\u0026rdquo;, i.e. the results of the computation that was left on the stack. I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked into the Go call semantics enough to understand the difference between AX and the stuff returned on the stack, but regardless of wether I understand it or not, oldstack saves it. Then oldstack pulls a trick like newstack, exiting via gogo, which moves to the old stack by setting SP and PC to the values that morestack staved from the caller way back when.\nOpen question: if morestack is called twice before oldstack is called, why isn\u0026rsquo;t the original caller\u0026rsquo;s SP/PC stomped?\nSo, now you\u0026rsquo;ve been all the way down the rabbit hole with me.

They are meant for client use. They implement things from the point of view of a naïve client, one that just wants to give a URL and get back the results. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to chase redirects, they don\u0026rsquo;t want to set their headers specially, they just want to, in one line, get the results.\nWhen you are writing an HTTP proxy server, you can\u0026rsquo;t be so naïve. For example, the HTTP client in a proxy server must not do redirect chasing. Instead, it needs to get the redirect status code and Location header, and then send it back down to the proxy\u0026rsquo;s client. If it wants to chase the redirect, fine.\nIf you read the guts of http.Get and http.Post, they prepare http.Request structures with the right stuff inside, then pass them to an internal function called send. So you might think you should do something like this as well, for instance writing something like what\u0026rsquo;s inside the http.send function yourself. However, this is the wrong way to go, there\u0026rsquo;s a better way.\nThe trick is to make an http.ClientConn, then feed the http.Request into it, and read the http.Response out of it. If you want to keep the connection open, you can (set req.Close to false), then you can do more HTTP requests on the same connection later. The ServeHTTP function in my proxy demonstrates how to do this, in the case where you close the connection. Creating a connection pool is on the to-do list, though my first guess on how to do it is to let a single goroutine act as the warehouse of open connections, checking them out and back in to the central cache in response to messages on a channel.\nAn HTTP proxy needs to copy through the headers from the proxy client to the origin server. However, some headers, like those related to the transfer format and connection closure should not be copied through. This is sort of a weakness in the HTTP protocol, that it confuses transport and content like this, but it is what it is and we\u0026rsquo;ve got to deal with it.\nOne thing that gave me a bit of trouble was oreq.RawURL. I originally set it to creq.RawURL, then used http.ParseURL(oreq.RawURL) to fill in oreq.URL (with an error check, of course). The problem is that http.Request.Write() will prefer the contents of RawURL to URL. That means that you send the full URL to the origin server, instead of only the path part. With some servers, they don\u0026rsquo;t care. With others, it results in wildly incorrect redirects, for instance fetching \u0026ldquo;http://blog.nella.org\u0026rdquo; (no trailing slash: should result in a redirect to /) gives a Location of \u0026ldquo;blog.nella.org/\u0026rdquo;, which in turn results in your browser \u0026ldquo;/blog.nella.org/\u0026rdquo;. Redundantly, repetitively false and incorrect.\nI also wondered if it even makes sense to re-parse the URL\nWith this addition to the proxy code mentioned yesterday, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a basic HTTP proxy that I\u0026rsquo;ve used to surf many different static and dynamic sites. It seems to work, at least well enough as a base to experiment with. Next stop, the cachability check, and adding the right code to ServeHTTP to redirect cachable requests to the object on disk instead of getting it from the origin server.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2011/02/08/how-to-control-your-http-transactions-in-go/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Go http pacakge has http.Get and http.Post, which make it easy to do GET and POST operations.

Missed a week due to a nice little ski vacation, but I promise I was dreaming of Go while riding the ski lifts, so I\u0026rsquo;ve got something interesting to share with you this week.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve worked in Africa and Indonesia in the past. There, I saw first-hand the possibilities of the Internet, but also the difficulties of using it in remote areas, over slow links, etc. I came up with ideas years ago for what I\u0026rsquo;d like in a proxy in the field that would make the limited bandwidth on a satellite connection go further. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had a chance to implement it until now, because hacking on Squid or other proxies just involved too much C hacking and core dumping to suit my patience, especially for a prototype to test ideas on. But Go, on the other hand; it\u0026rsquo;s just made for playing with this kind of thing!\nSo today what I have to show you is an HTTP proxy that simulates what happens when all the requests are squeezed through a tiny little channel. It does not simulate things down to the TCP level (i.e. congestion detection and backoff); nor does it simulate the long round-trip times that make satellite connections difficult to optimize. But it simulates low bandwidth, and when I later add features related to semi-offline use, it will help me show the benefits of them better, I think.\nThe HTTP package in Go seems to be a just a web client and a web server. The tutorials show how to use it for both. Making a server is easy: you call http.ListenAndServe(\u0026quot;:1234\u0026quot;, nil) and you end up with a web server on port 1234. But did you ever wonder what that extra argument is for? The nil at the end? It\u0026rsquo;s the secret to how to make a proxy, and it\u0026rsquo;s the first stop on our journey.\nhttp.Handler\nThe second argument is an http.Handler. When you set it to nil, the http package provides a default, called http.ServeMux. It is designed to let you register callbacks for various sub-URLs inside one server. There\u0026rsquo;s also the http.FileServer handler, which finds files on disk matching the URL, and serves them up.\nThe trick to writing an HTTP proxy with the Go http package is to make your own http.Handler. Here\u0026rsquo;s something like what my first shot at it was:\ntype Proxy struct { } func NewProxy() *Proxy { return \u0026amp;Proxy{} } func (p *Proxy) ServeHTTP(wr http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { var resp *http.Response var err os.Error switch r.Method { default: { log.Print(\u0026#34;Cannot handle method \u0026#34;, r.Method) http.Error(wr, \u0026#34;501 I only handle GET and POST\u0026#34;, http.StatusNotImplemented) return } case \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;: { log.Printf(\u0026#34;getting %v\u0026#34;, r.RawURL) resp, _, err = http.Get(r.RawURL) } case \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;: { resp, err = http.Post(r.RawURL, r.Header[\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;], r.Body) r.Body.Close() } } // combined for GET/POST if err != nil { http.Error(wr, err.String(), http.StatusInternalServerError) loghit(r, http.StatusInternalServerError, false) return } wr.SetHeader(\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;, resp.Header[\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;]) wr.WriteHeader(resp.StatusCode) io.Copy(wr, resp.Body) resp.Body.Close() loghit(r, resp.StatusCode, false) } And I use it like this:\nfunc main() { proxy := NewProxy() err := http.ListenAndServe(\u0026#34;:12345\u0026#34;, proxy) if err != nil { log.Exit(\u0026#34;ListenAndServe: \u0026#34;, err.String()) } } Note that my new type, Proxy, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anything in it. Though it might pick up more stuff later, for now, it\u0026rsquo;s job is to have the ServeHTTP method attached to it, so that *Proxy can satisfy the http.Handler interface. The real proxy behavior happens in ServeHTTP, where we turn incoming GETs and POSTs into outgoing GETs and POSTs, then arrange that the answers from the origin server go back to the requester. The key line that does that is io.Copy, where we copy the bytes arriving on the response from the origin server onto the request that came from the HTTP client (i.e. the web browser configured with localhost:12345 as it\u0026rsquo;s proxy server).\nNow, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to see that we can implement a caching proxy by looking at the request arriving in the http.Request, and either take something off of disk or get something from the network to fill in the http.ResponseWriter. That\u0026rsquo;s one direction we can expand this proxy, and I hope to do that in coming weeks, to implement a proxy that can use packages of offline content to dramatically reduce the amount of network traffic.\nIt does, however, take a rocket scientist to get HTTP proxying and caching right. For caching, there are several headers that have to be parsed and consulted, including Expires, E-tag, Cache-control and If-modified-since. Even getting proxying right, without caching is not so easy. To get anything working at all, the code above had to copy across the Content-Type header. But by not copying headers from the client inbound to the proxy, and by not copying all the headers back from the origin server, we are breaking cookies and HTTP redirect.\nIn fact, this issue of broken redirects lead me on a big side-trip where I learned more about the http package, and improved the proxy. I\u0026rsquo;ll write about that in a second post, so that we can keep going here to the next interesting thing.\nYou can see the source to the proxy here, but beware, ServeHTTP has morphed quite a bit from the super-simple GET/POST thing above. But you\u0026rsquo;ll have to read the next article to find out why.\nlinkio\nThe next thing I have to show you, the reader, is something called linkio. This is a package I wrote which wraps an io.Reader so that when you read from it, you get the bytes back at the same speed they would arrive if they were coming over a fixed capacity link to you, sharing bandwidth with all the other traffic on the link.\nlinkio shows two interesting Go design patterns. First, it is a wrapper for the io.Reader interface. The constructor takes an io.Reader as input, then stores it away, along with some other information. The object returned by the constructor satisfies io.Reader, so it can be plugged in exactly where the previous io.Reader was. Take a look at the code that needs to change to make use of linkio:\nimport ( ... \u0026#34;jra-go.googlecode.com/hg/linkio\u0026#34; ) var gLink *linkio.Link func init() { gLink = linkio.NewLink(56 /* kbps */) } ... // then in ServeHttp, change this: io.Copy(wr, resp.Body) // to this: io.Copy(wr, gLink.NewLinkReader(resp.Body)) Note how the real change in the program is one line! That\u0026rsquo;s because all the timing stuff, and the way to multiplex all the transactions onto a single link is put inside of linkio, and the goroutine launched inside the NewLink constructor.\nThe second interesting thing is that linkio uses a buffered channel to simulate the link itself. Each LinkReader wants to release it\u0026rsquo;s data in dribs and drabs to the reader, according to the current shared state of the link. The defining characteristic of a link is that it can send data for only one stream at a time (when we zoom in the the level of individual packets, anyway). So we simulate it with a goroutine that loops on the input channel (representing the interleaved flow of packets) and sleeps according to how long each packet would occupy the link in real life. If the link is unoccupied, then the loop gets blocked on the channel read. Once a simulated packet arrives (called a linkRequest in the code), the loop then becomes blocked on the sleep. When the sleep is done, the link goroutine needs to tell the stream that requested that this packet be simulated that the sleep is done. It does that by sending a bool on the channel that arrived with the simulated packet. (This pattern of sending a channel with a request to another goroutine is the Go idiom for asynchronous notification. A very useful trick: learn it!)\nThis scheme only works if the LinkReaders let loose their data a little at a time. If one sent in a simulated packet that was 10 megabytes, it would ruin the effect. That one \u0026ldquo;packet\u0026rdquo; would hog the link to the exclusion of all others, making that one stream perceive a bit rate of 100% of the link, instead of it\u0026rsquo;s equal share. The place where the LinkReaders enforce this fairness is in func (* linkio.LinkReader)Read. The prototype is Read([]byte) n int, os.Error err. When len(buf) is 1000, there\u0026rsquo;s no requirement to actually return 1000 bytes. You can return any number of bytes less than or equal to cap(buf), using n to tell the caller how many of the bytes in buf are valid, new bytes that they should read.\nSo, there you have it. A nice little example of a multi-threaded, rate-limiting HTTP proxy in Go. Stay tuned to the next article, where I explain why http.Get and http.Post are not really what you want in an HTTP proxy, and how to get what you DO want from the http package.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2011/02/07/a-rate-limiting-http-proxy-in-go/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello Go-fans.

Now, of course, the world didn\u0026rsquo;t need another console server, but it turned out to be an interesting experiment, because what a console server does is well suited to the tools Go gives a programmer. A console server\u0026rsquo;s job is to gather the output from one or more serial cables (or, when there\u0026rsquo;s a terminal server in the mix, one or more TCP connections implementing the Rtelnet \u0026ldquo;protocol\u0026rdquo;). It logs that output to files, and makes the output available in realtime to zero or more watchers. It allows one and only one of the watchers to be read-write, to actually control the device.\nThe Go version of the console server is called gocons. Go have a look at it, and then come back here. As usual, I want to point out some things I learned about Go while writing it.\nMy first attempt at making this thing work was with netchan. I thought it would be cool if the client could send in a request to the server asking to be notified on a certain channel when events happened on a certain console. But that crashed and burned because netchan can\u0026rsquo;t send channels. I think it would be theoretically possible to put the right stuff together to make it possible for netchan to send channels, but it would obviously be really hard, and the semantics of the channels would never really be the same. So, moving right along\u0026hellip;\nThe next idea was to use the rpc package to implement the protocol between the client and the server. But that ran up onto another problem; RPC, by its very definition is synchronous. There is no clear way to use the RPC package to let the server send down asynchronous events to the client, like \u0026ldquo;these bytes arrived\u0026rdquo;. What I needed was to write my own wire protocol, one that could do both synchronous calls like \u0026ldquo;Can I listen to this? Yes.\u0026rdquo; and also asynchronous events like, \u0026ldquo;the console you are watching just output these bytes\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve written protocols before, and it\u0026rsquo;s not hard, just a bit finicky. But Go provides the gob package, and that\u0026rsquo;s all you need to make a protocol.\nSo what you do is define types that represent the protocol messages and then let gob take responsibility for marshalling and unmarshalling, as well as figuring out the message delimiters. In our case, the types are called connReq and connReply. In a perfect world, these would be public types in some library, and the client and the server would both use them. In gocons, I got lazy and just copied and pasted them. The client does a gob.Decode on the net.TCPConn, and the result has to be a connReq (if it isn\u0026rsquo;t, something went wrong, and the client could either kill the connection, or try to decode the next thing on the connection). Because Go doesn\u0026rsquo;t have unions (they aren\u0026rsquo;t type safe) the connReq and connReply have to have all the fields in them that could be needed, even if a given protocol message doesn\u0026rsquo;t use them all. I haven\u0026rsquo;t calculated the protocol overhead of this, but because the potentially unused fields are things like byte slices and strings, it can\u0026rsquo;t be much; and empty byte slice will be encoded as a nil, not as a bunch of zeros for the whole underlying byte buffer.\nA more sophisticated version of this idea might be to make a heirarchy of types, the base one being the simplest (with only an int in it to indicate the type) and the more complicated ones embedding the base one. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to know what type you\u0026rsquo;d give to gob.Decode to write into; it seems like you\u0026rsquo;d have to separate out the two halves of the protocol message and send them with two calls to go.Encode. The first would be the int telling what kind it is, then the second gob would be precisely the right \u0026ldquo;shape\u0026rdquo; for the data. In any case, I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it that way for gocons. Simpler is better!\nIn the server, there are two pieces of code that are kind of interesting. One is the use of JSON for the config file format. The other is how incoming data it sent out to all the listeners.\nFirst the simple one. It\u0026rsquo;s just an example of how to grab data out of a JSON file without using json.Unmarshall. I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand it, so while playing with json.Decode, I managed to get this working, and just left it at that. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim this is nice or pretty, but it works, and it might be useful to other people looking for examples on how to read JSON in Go.\nThe expected input is something like this:\n{ \u0026#34;consoles\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;firewall\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ts.company.com:2070\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;web01\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ts.company.com:2071\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;web02\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ts.company.com:2072\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;web03\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ts.company.com:2073\u0026#34; } } The goal is to call addConsole once for each of the key/value pairs in the consoles hash.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to (or know how to) use json.Unmarshal:\nr, err := os.Open(*config, os.O_RDONLY, 0) if err != nil { log.Exitf(\u0026#34;Cannot read config file %v: %v\u0026#34;, *config, err) } dec := json.NewDecoder(r) var conf interface{} err = dec.Decode(\u0026amp;conf) if err != nil { log.Exit(\u0026#34;JSON decode: \u0026#34;, err) } hash, ok := conf.(map[string]interface{}) if !ok { log.Exit(\u0026#34;JSON format error: got %T\u0026#34;, conf) } consoles, ok := hash[\u0026#34;consoles\u0026#34;] if !ok { log.Exit(\u0026#34;JSON format error: key consoles not found\u0026#34;) } c2, ok := consoles.(map[string]interface{}) if !ok { log.Exitf(\u0026#34;JSON format error: consoles key wrong type, %T\u0026#34;, consoles) } for k, v := range c2 { s, ok := v.(string) if ok { addConsole(k, s) } else { log.Exit(\u0026#34;Dial string for console %v is not a string.\u0026#34;, k) } } The general pattern here is that json.Decode gives you interface{}, and you need to use type selectors to work your way down the structure, and actually get the stuff you expect to be there out of it.\nAn infinitely prettier way to do this is to use json.Unmarshal. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit hard to understand from the docs, but this blog post makes it crystal clear.\nThe server is made up of a series of goroutines each running in blocking loops to handle their bit of i/o. Each console that is monitored has a read goroutine and a write one. The reader brings bytes in from it, and dispatches them to all the gocons clients who are listening. It maintains the list of clients in a linked list, but another data structure would work as well. The key is that the clients are not stored in the list as net.TCPConn\u0026rsquo;s, but as channels. What\u0026rsquo;s watching the other end of those channels for new data is the client\u0026rsquo;s proxy goroutine. Each time a client connects, a pair of goroutines are created, one for read, one for write. This allows us to do blocking reads on the input (search for dec.Decode for an example) without worrying about blocking other jobs in the server.\nBy keeping one single goroutine in charge of writing over the TCP connection, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do any locking. You could, in principle, have multiple console managers all saying, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got something that should be multiplexed onto that TCP connection!\u0026rdquo; but not worry about them stomping on each other while writing to the connection. (The current implementation only listens to one console at a time.)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a snippet showing how we package up and send the notification that something new arrived on to all the console watchers:\nselect { // a bunch of other channels to monitor here... case data := \u0026lt;-m.dataCh: if closed(m.dataCh) { break L } // multicast the data to the listeners for l := listeners; l != nil; l = l.next { if closed(l.ch) { // TODO: need to remove this node from the list, not just mark nil l.ch = nil log.Print(\u0026#34;Marking listener \u0026#34;, l, \u0026#34; no longer active.\u0026#34;) } if l.ch != nil { ok := l.ch \u0026lt;- consoleEvent{data} if !ok { log.Print(\u0026#34;Listener \u0026#34;, l, \u0026#34; lost an event.\u0026#34;) } } } So, we make a new consoleEvent and send it to each listener. This is a bit wasteful: it makes a lot of garbage, which means the garbage collector will need to work harder. It might have been possible to make one consoleEvent, then send the same one to all the listeners. But if you are going to share memory like that, it is up to the programmer to insure that the receivers of the shared memory either treat it as read only, or use a mutex to control access to it. In our case, it is used in a read-only way, but far away in the code:\n// new event arrived from the console manager, so send it down the TCP connection case ev := \u0026lt;-evCh: reply.code = Data reply.data = ev.data err := enc.Encode(reply) if err != nil { log.Print(\u0026#34;connection \u0026#34;, c.rw, \u0026#34;, failed to send data: \u0026#34;, err) break L } This model, of two goroutines per thing that needs reading and writing, is magic. It dramatically reduced the code needed to implement gocons. The original console server has hundreds of lines of complicated code worrying about setting up the select mask, waiting on select, deciding if the signaled fd needs an accept(), or a read() or whatever (and finding the right data structures that correspond to the fd that just became usable). In gocons, and other idiomatic Go programs like the http server implemented in package http, you use blocking reads, and let the Go runtime arrange for the system has a whole to not block.\nIt is interesting to think about what would happen if writing to a client TCP connection were to block, though. As the blockingness is transitive in this system as written, it would eventually back up and block the thing that\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be reading from the console, blocking all other clients. To protect against that, you need to put some firewalls in place; shared resources should not let individuals block them. You\u0026rsquo;d need to put short queues on the channels between the client proxy goroutines and the console manager reading goroutine, then have it do non-blocking writes on the channel, and if one would block, do something about it. For example, it could close the channel, in order to say, \u0026ldquo;hey, you\u0026rsquo;re not draining things, and you need to clean up your act and come back to me later\u0026rdquo;.\nWriting and debugging this server in Go made me learn a bunch of things. I\u0026rsquo;ve still got lots to learn; the code still has some mysteries in it, like why I need a runtime.Gosched() to keep things from blocking, and how to deal with the fact that a closed channel causes a select to always fire on it. There\u0026rsquo;s another workaround for a mystery hidden in setOwner: my first approach uncovered a bug (in the Go runtime, or in my understanding of it) that I had to workaround with a \u0026ldquo;pump goroutine\u0026rdquo; that forwards data from one place to another.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2011/01/17/gobs-on-the-wire/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis week, I want to talk about how to use Go to write a client/server system with both synchronous requests and asynchronous event notifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help learn Go, I wrote a clone of the \u003ca href=\"http://conserver.com\"\u003eConserver console server\u003c/a\u003e.

It allows one and only one of the watchers to be read-write, to actually control the device.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Gobs on the wire"},{"content":"Last week I showed how a channel could link a producer and a consumer, and I idly speculated on how you\u0026rsquo;d set the depth of the queue, relative to the rate and variability of the producer and the consumer\u0026rsquo;s need for new input.\nThis weekend, I got to thinking about my next interesting Go project. It will be an HTTP proxy that can do some nifty tricks to offload a slow Internet link. One of the features I thought I might add would be something to send all the new HTML it sees through a secondary processing system in order to find extra assets it might want to cache. This is a case of a producer that wants to act totally independently of the consumer. If the secondary processing goroutine is slow, or hung inserting something into a database, or whatever, the producer (the HTTP reply) can\u0026rsquo;t hang \u0026ndash; he needs to reply to the client.\nThe solution is to hook up a dispatcher between the producer and one or more consumers. If you just wanted several consumers working, they can just all read from the same channel, and safely take the next item. But if you want to give some kind of guarantee to the producer that it won\u0026rsquo;t hang, you need to put the dispatcher in the loop. (Of course, the producer can also check for itself that it\u0026rsquo;s not going to hang by doing a non-blocking write on the channel, then throw away the work unit if it would block. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t want things getting thrown away, the dispatcher solution is better.) The dispatcher is written so that it can\u0026rsquo;t block. It finds a consumer ready to take the work unit, and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, then it makes a new one and sends the work unit to the new consumer. If the consumers are too slow, instead of making more of them (risking to make the system suffer collapse) it panics. Not nice, but better to fail fast, and clearly.\nThe result is in the jra-go.googlecode.com/hg repository as a module named autocon. Have a look.\nAs usual, I want to point out some things I liked/disliked about how this turned out.\nFirst, take a look at the autoConsumer type: it\u0026rsquo;s private. Why? Because the interface this thing gives to the outside world (the producer) is just a channel. The producer doesn\u0026rsquo;t get a pointer to an object, it just gets the channel it will be talking to. If you wanted to tune or monitor the dispatcher, this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. But I decided to start out with the simplest thing, and this is it. In fact, when it came time to write the tests cases in autocon_test.go I had a problem; I wanted to know what was happening inside, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a pointer to the autoConsumer to go dig into it, because once NewAutoConsumer returns, the only thing in the entire system that has a pointer to the autoConsumer is run(). I solved that problem with lexically bound channels, so that my workers had access to the same channel that the test routine did. Then the test routine empties the channel looking to see if the right amount of garbage comes out of it (nothing more, nothing less).\nOne thing that\u0026rsquo;s not too nice is I had to add a runtime.Gosched in the test routines to get them to work. And as usual with scheduling problems, it\u0026rsquo;s sensitive. When I was debugging scheduling problems using fmt.Print, I got different behavior than when I debugged using println. Why? Because the fmt package uses a channel to implement a leaky bucket of unused pp structures, and the scheduling decisions are disrupted by popping and pushing them inside of fmt.Println. Lesson: beware of fmt when debugging scheduler problems.\nA better solution to finessing the scheduler with runtime.Gosched would be to arrange for a positive signal to come back that the workers had run and done their job and were ready to have the work checked. But because channels don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;wait until 10 are outstanding\u0026rdquo; kind of primitive, I would have instead needed to implement some kind of condition variable. It didn\u0026rsquo;t seem like the right place, down in a test routine, to be doing that!\nAnother thing I really don\u0026rsquo;t like about Go, but don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution for, is the boilerplate \u0026ldquo;if closed()\u0026rdquo; after \u0026ldquo;for x := range ch\u0026rdquo;. When a goroutine is blocked on a read on a channel, and another goroutine closes it, the channel becomes readable. The result it returns is a nil. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to litter your code with a bunch of \u0026ldquo;if x != nil\u0026rdquo;, you need to catch that case early and bail out. Luckily, the closed() primitive tells you what you need to know. I think the behavior of closed channels is just right in Go as it is; it is the unavoidable reality check you get when you go from beautiful theory into ugly practice.\nAnd while I am beating up on myself, let me point out that I\u0026rsquo;m using a label and a labeled goto. Using labels always seems to me like some kind of failure; like it\u0026rsquo;s just four little characters short of a goto. But the need is undeniable; when you call break inside of nested for loops, the language spec says that the innermost loop will be broken. In this case, I don\u0026rsquo;t need it, but it somehow improves readability, in that the label explains exactly which loop we are exiting and why. I am deeply conflicted about loop labels, and I suppose the only answer is to keep using them until I get over it, or until I break the habit.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2011/01/11/the-impatient-producer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week I showed how a channel could link a producer and a consumer, and I idly speculated on how you\u0026rsquo;d set the depth of the queue, relative to the rate and variability of the producer and the consumer\u0026rsquo;s need for new input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weekend, I got to thinking about my next interesting Go project.

So here\u0026rsquo;s a little something I dug out of my stocking to get things going again.\nI thought an interesting way to play with the exp/draw package, the http client, and the image decoder would be a program to animate the tiles from Google Maps, showing the world scrolling by, as though you were in an airplane looking straight down and flying in a straight line. It came to me in one of those flying dreams\u0026hellip; (not really).\nThe general idea is simple: fetch a tile, and display it, animating it by sliding it to the left while fetching the next one to the east and ensuring that you either get it before the last one scrolled off, or stop the scrolling. That\u0026rsquo;s a perfect job for goroutines; one should be fetching and one should be in charge of drawing, and should block if the other one is not done. And they should talk via a channel, like all well behaved goroutines do. Because channels are ordered and can be buffered, the channel between the fetcher and the displayer can play the part of a queue in this producer/consumer system. Simple and elegant, just how we like it to be in Go-land.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the program. You can also get by running \u0026ldquo;goinstall jra-go.googlecode.com/hg\u0026rdquo;, then go look in your $GOROOT/src/pkg/jra-go.googlecode.com/hg/cmd/mapscroll directory.\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;log\u0026#34; \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; \u0026#34;http\u0026#34; \u0026#34;exp/draw\u0026#34; \u0026#34;exp/draw/x11\u0026#34; \u0026#34;image\u0026#34; \u0026#34;image/png\u0026#34; \u0026#34;image/jpeg\u0026#34; ) func imagePuller(urls chan string, imgs chan *image.Image) { for url := range urls { r, _, err := http.Get(url) if err == nil { log.Print(\u0026#34;Fetched \u0026#34;, url) ctype, found := r.Header[\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;] if found { switch { default: log.Print(\u0026#34;For \u0026#34;, url, \u0026#34;, unknown type: \u0026#34;, ctype) case ctype == \u0026#34;image/png\u0026#34;: img, err := png.Decode(r.Body) if err == nil { imgs \u0026lt;- \u0026amp;img } else { log.Print(\u0026#34;For \u0026#34;, url, \u0026#34;, decode error: \u0026#34;, err) } case ctype == \u0026#34;image/jpeg\u0026#34; || ctype == \u0026#34;image/jpg\u0026#34;: img, err := jpeg.Decode(r.Body) if err == nil { imgs \u0026lt;- \u0026amp;img } else { log.Print(\u0026#34;For \u0026#34;, url, \u0026#34;, decode error: \u0026#34;, err) return } } } else { log.Print(\u0026#34;For \u0026#34;, url, \u0026#34;, no content type.\u0026#34;) } r.Body.Close() } else { log.Print(\u0026#34;Error fetching \u0026#34;, url, \u0026#34;: \u0026#34;, err) } } } func urlGen(urls chan string) { x := 33981 y := 23179 for { url := fmt.Sprintf(\u0026#34;http://khm1.google.com/kh/v=74\u0026amp;x=%d\u0026amp;s=\u0026amp;y=%d\u0026amp;z=16\u0026amp;s=Ga\u0026#34;, x, y) urls \u0026lt;- url x++ } } func processEvent(ch \u0026lt;-chan interface{}) { for { if closed(ch) { log.Exit(\u0026#34;X display closed.\u0026#34;) } ev, ok := \u0026lt;-ch if !ok { // no events, return return } switch ev.(type) { case draw.ErrEvent: log.Exit(\u0026#34;X11 err: \u0026#34;, ev.(draw.ErrEvent).Err) } } } func main() { urls := make(chan string, 4) imgReady := make(chan *image.Image, 4) go imagePuller(urls, imgReady) go urlGen(urls) xdisp, err := x11.NewWindow() if err != nil { log.Exit(\u0026#34;X11 error: \u0026#34;, err) } screen := xdisp.Screen() tileHeight := 256 tileWidth := 256 numTiles := screen.Bounds().Dx()/tileWidth + 2 tileStrip := image.NewRGBA(numTiles*tileWidth, tileHeight) // pre-load the tile strip for i := 0; i \u0026lt; numTiles; i++ { iptr := \u0026lt;-imgReady img := *iptr draw.Draw(tileStrip, image.Rect(i*tileWidth, 0, i*tileWidth+tileWidth, tileHeight), img, image.ZP) } topBlack := (screen.Bounds().Dy() - tileHeight) / 2 for { for x := 0; x \u0026lt; tileWidth; x += 15 { then := time.Nanoseconds() draw.Draw(screen, image.Rect(0, topBlack, screen.Bounds().Dx(), topBlack+tileHeight), tileStrip, image.Pt(x, 0)) now := time.Nanoseconds() frameTime := now - then // a flush is just a write on a channel, so it takes negligible time xdisp.FlushImage() toSleep := 0.1*1e9 - frameTime // log.Print(\u0026#34;Took \u0026#34;, frameTime, \u0026#34; ns to draw, will sleep \u0026#34;, toSleep, \u0026#34; ns\u0026#34;) time.Sleep(toSleep) processEvent(xdisp.EventChan()) } // shift tiles in tileStrip and put in new last one draw.Draw(tileStrip, image.Rect(0, 0, (numTiles-1)*tileWidth, tileHeight), tileStrip, image.Pt(tileWidth, 0)) iptr := \u0026lt;-imgReady img := *iptr draw.Draw(tileStrip, image.Rect((numTiles-1)*tileWidth, 0, numTiles*tileWidth, tileHeight), img, image.ZP) } } Some little details to point out:\nNote how I made the goroutine that fetches urls read from a chan string to get its URLs instead of making them up itself. This compartmentalizes the logic, and has nothing to do with parallelism. A good practice in Go is to use channels to improve clarity, not only as part of a scheme to increase parallelism. Your goal is to express the intrinsic \u0026ldquo;this hands to this\u0026rdquo; nature of your program, and if that results in a speedup with multiple cores, fine. If it just results in clearer code, even better!\nThe imgReady channel is buffered, 4 deep. That means I\u0026rsquo;ll have 4 images queued up and ready at all times. When the head is popped, there are 3 left. If each tile took 1 second to scroll by, then the maximum delay for any one fetch would be 3 seconds, and the fetches should average under one second. For this little app, it\u0026rsquo;s over thinking it; but the same analysis would hold for other asynchronous producer/consumer systems of this type.\nThe images themselves are not sent through the channel, only pointers to them. This is to reduce the amount of copying that the runtime has to do. For this application the difference would probably be almost undetectable, just a minor increase in CPU time (the dominant user of CPU time is the draw.Draw which moves the strip across the screen). But it seemed like a perfect place to be sending pointers instead of the objects themselves; in Go we share memory by communicating, not communicate by sharing. But a good compromise is where one goroutine says to the other \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m done with the thing we can both access that is at the end of this pointer, you take it\u0026rdquo;.\nThe animation in this beast is definitely not the smoothest and most beautiful. The way exp/draw/x11 puts stuff on the screen is pretty costly, and it is too far removed from the X server itself to be able to synchronize updates and avoid flashing artifacts. Remember that the \u0026ldquo;exp\u0026rdquo; in exp/draw/x11 means \u0026ldquo;experimental\u0026rdquo; and it probably won\u0026rsquo;t stay around for the long haul. Perhaps linking against an OpenGL library using cgo would let me make the animation smoother. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll look into that one day\u0026hellip;\nTake a look at that unassuming processEvents hidden down in the middle of the inner loop. It is important to get things to close down nicely, and even to keep your window running without blocking on unhanded events. Without it, if you close the window, the system keeps fetching and updating the in-memory copy of the screen image. Every time through, processEvents empties the event channel, ignoring stuff it doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about. This is important, because if the event channels fill up, the X11 window hangs because the sends to the event channel are blocking (see $GOROOT/src/pkg/exp/draw/x11/conn.go, search for eventc). Even if you have no UI, you still need to empty that sucker, because just moving the mouse over the window creates events. (I can\u0026rsquo;t reproduce the theoretical hang I\u0026rsquo;m talking about now, so I could be wrong on this part. But empty the channel, just to be safe.)\nUpdate: Andrew tells me that not bailing early is non-idiomatic (see imagePuller, \u0026ldquo;if found\u0026rdquo;) and results in more indents than necessary. I tend to agree, but obviously I\u0026rsquo;m not quite yet in the habit of doing things the Go way. Thanks for the feedback, Andrew.\nPS: The starting location is Lausanne, my beautiful city. The x++ causes it to fly due east from Lausanne. If you wait until you get to 180 degrees east, it will likely fail, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t handle global wraparound right. :)\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2011/01/03/using-a-channel-as-a-queue/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI try to write a Go article every Monday, but the holiday season has disrupted me a bit.

This turns out to be the key to a simpler way to achieve what I wanted to do.\nBy simpler I mean, \u0026ldquo;no cgo\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s a nice simplification, because up until recently, your final static binary image linked to the cgo code dynamically, and that made using my technique impossible in the context of the Tiny runtime, where there is no dynamic linker. Recently cgo has changed, but at the same time, I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered how to use native strings to do what I want, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how it works.\nI shied away from strings at first because I understood them to be \u0026ldquo;unicode strings\u0026rdquo;, and thus not eligible to hold arbitrary bytes (i.e. bytes which turn out to create a non-valid unicode rune). That\u0026rsquo;s not true at all. In Go, the string type is in some ways an alias for \u0026ldquo;an immutable array of 8-bit octets\u0026rdquo;, i.e. an [\u0026hellip;]byte. True, many of the built-in functions that operate on string expect what\u0026rsquo;s inside of it to be valid UTF-8, and might malfunction if you give them random bytes. But there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to keep you from putting bad UTF-8 in, then never using the functions that expect good UTF-8.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s the plan. We put our individual bytes into the string, then we do brain surgery to turn them into a []byte:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;unsafe\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) var empty [0]byte var str1 string = \u0026#34;the string\u0026#34; var str2 string = \u0026#34;another string\u0026#34; func fix(s string) (b []byte) { sx := (*reflect.StringHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026amp;s)) b = empty[:] bx := (*reflect.SliceHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026amp;b)) bx.Data = sx.Data bx.Len = len(s) bx.Cap = len(s) return } func main() { b := fix(str1) println(b[0]) b = fix(str2) println(b[0]) b[0] = \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; // crash: write to ro segment } When you read the assembly of that program, there\u0026rsquo;s not a memcpy to be seen. The []byte you get points directly at the original bytes. You could also see that by taking the address of str[0] and b[0] and seeing that they are the same byte in memory.\nThe last line shows why Go is going to so much trouble to prevent me from doing this: the memory that is now underlying my []byte is read-only. At link time, the linker put it into a read-only segment, and now when I write to it, I get this (the equivalent of a segfault in Go):\nunexpected fault address 0x80640f8 throw: fault panic PC=0xf765b048 runtime.throw+0x3e /home/jeffall/go/src/pkg/runtime/runtime.c:73 runtime.throw(0x80a3916, 0x80640f8) runtime.sigpanic+0xc7 /home/jeffall/go/src/pkg/runtime/linux/thread.c:288 runtime.sigpanic() main.main+0xd8 /home/jeffall/go-stuff/str.go:27 main.main() runtime.mainstart+0xf /home/jeffall/go/src/pkg/runtime/386/asm.s:84 runtime.mainstart() runtime.goexit /home/jeffall/go/src/pkg/runtime/proc.c:148 runtime.goexit() Working on this has made me ask myself a few times, \u0026ldquo;why am I so intent on turning read-only memory into a []byte, thereby corrupting Go\u0026rsquo;s type safety?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m still grappling with that, stay tuned. (One reason why is that this whole idea came from working in the Tiny Go environment, where there\u0026rsquo;s currently almost no memory protection offered anyway. But that\u0026rsquo;s a dumb reason; if the non-existent OS can\u0026rsquo;t save you from yourself, you certainly should NOT stop the compiler from saving you!) Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a third version coming which manages to keep it type safe and still do what I want. I suspect it\u0026rsquo;s going to have something to do with changing the interface of my filesystem object to keep the string itself internal, and only expose a method that returns an io.Reader.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2010/12/17/a-simpler-way-to-embed-data/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my post about how to efficiently put data into a Go binary, I mentioned that strings are immutable, and can be accessed without causing the Go runtime to copy them.

I was planning on just using a map from name to file contents, which would work ok. But then I remembered seeing the archive/zip package, and I thought how much cooler it would be to just make my prototype filesystem, zip it up, put the zip file into my Go program (see last post) and then access the filesystem via the archive/zip package later.\nzip.Decode doesn\u0026rsquo;t want an io.Reader like lots of Go libraries. Instead it wants an io.ReaderAt. This makes sense, because a Zip file has a table of contents, allowing you to efficiently jump around the archive and pull out just one file. So then I went looking for how to turn a []byte into an io.ReaderAt. I looked all through the bytes package and came up short.\nSo I did it myself. Here\u0026rsquo;s how, in case you come across the same kind of problem:\ntype seekable []byte func NewSeekable(buf []byte) seekable { return buf } func (r seekable)ReadAt(p []byte, off int64) (n int, err os.Error) { o := int(off) copy(p, r[o:o+len(p)]) return len(p), nil } Now you can do something like this:\nb := fs.FileMap[\u0026#34;/tmp/test.zip\u0026#34;] n, err := zip.NewReader(NewSeekable(b), int64(len(b))) Warning: The implementation of ReadAt probably has some bugs around the edge cases. I wrote it very fast while just trying to see if this approach would work. There\u0026rsquo;s also a mismatch of integer sizes that is not handled well by this code. It could be you could reason that you\u0026rsquo;d never see a problem, but the way it is currently written (by me!) does not pass my \u0026ldquo;smell test\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2010/12/13/where-is-bytesnewreaderat/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have a nice source of []byte slices (see last post), and now I\u0026rsquo;d like to do something with them that resembles a filesystem.

My current goal is to get a new backend for exp/draw working which writes to the SVGA screen. It would be cool to be able to decode the Go mascot and have him flying around the screen or something.\nIn the Tiny runtime, there\u0026rsquo;s no OS, so there\u0026rsquo;s no disk drivers, so there\u0026rsquo;s no filesystem, so there\u0026rsquo;s no files. Which makes decoding a PNG and showing it kind of hard. But if the program carries along the data with it, in the form of a []byte, then you could use bytes.NewReader to turn it into an io.Reader and then pass it to image/png.Decode. So that\u0026rsquo;s what I set out to do.\nI got surprised by something, and that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m writing about today. Here\u0026rsquo;s the code that surprised me:\npackage main func main() { println([...]byte{\u0026#39;f\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;o\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;o\u0026#39;}[:]) } The resulting assembly is:\n... 8048c26 8b442404 | (4) MOVL 4(SP),AX 8048c2a 89c3 | (4) MOVL AX,BX 8048c2c 83c300 | (4) ADDL $0,BX // 102 = \u0026#39;f\u0026#39; 8048c2f c60366 | (4) MOVB $102,(BX) // put it in the array 8048c32 89c3 | (4) MOVL AX,BX 8048c34 43 | (4) INCL ,BX // increment and do it again... 8048c35 c6036f | (4) MOVB $111,(BX) 8048c38 89c3 | (4) MOVL AX,BX 8048c3a 83c302 | (4) ADDL $2,BX 8048c3d c6036f | (4) MOVB $111,(BX) 8048c40 890424 | (4) MOVL AX,(SP) 8048c43 c744240403000000 | (4) MOVL $3,4(SP) 8048c4b c744240800000000 | (4) MOVL $0,8(SP) 8048c53 c744240c00000000 | (4) MOVL $0,12(SP) 8048c5b c744241000000000 | (4) MOVL $0,16(SP) 8048c63 c744241403000000 | (4) MOVL $3,20(SP) 8048c6b c744241800000000 | (4) MOVL $0,24(SP) 8048c73 c744241c01000000 | (4) MOVL $1,28(SP) 8048c7b c744242000000000 | (4) MOVL $0,32(SP) 8048c83 e89d840000 | (4) CALL ,8051125+runtime.slicearray This is a pretty inefficient way to build a constant! I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have noticed, except that when I changed the simple \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo; above into the actual PNG I wanted to include in my program, 8g took so much memory the out of memory killer woke up and killed my Firefox! And we were talking about a little 80 kb PNG! The resulting ELF binary was 1.3 megs!\nThe syntax I used, namely \u0026ldquo;make an array then take a slice of it\u0026rdquo; turns out to be excessively complicated. The routine I was using expected a slice, so that\u0026rsquo;s how I ended up tacking the [:] on the end. Word to the wise: when the compiler is complaining about wanting a slice instead of an array, don\u0026rsquo;t just add the [:] on the end, give the compiler a chance to make the slice itself:\npackage main func main() { // there are 57 0\u0026#39;s here: println([]byte{ 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, }) } Here\u0026rsquo;s the resulting assembly:\n8048c17 83ec2c | (3) SUBL $44,SP // allocate a new array that\u0026#39;s 57 bytes long 8048c1a c7042439000000 | (4) MOVL $57,(SP) 8048c21 e85d1d0000 | (4) CALL ,804a983+runtime.new 8048c26 8b542404 | (4) MOVL 4(SP),DX // load the data from this place in the program\u0026#39;s image (my zeros are there; the file would be later) 8048c2a 8d35dc590508 | (4) LEAL main.statictmp_0001+0(SB),SI 8048c30 89d7 | (4) MOVL DX,DI 8048c32 fc | (4) CLD , // with a loop count of 14 8048c33 b90e000000 | (4) MOVL $14,CX // repeat 8048c38 f3 | (4) REP , // a move long 8048c39 a5 | (4) MOVSL , // and then one more byte (4 * 14 + 1 = 57) 8048c3a a4 | (4) MOVSB , // slice cap = 57 8048c3b c744242439000000 | (4) MOVL $57,main.autotmp_0000+36(SP) // slice len = 57 8048c43 c744242839000000 | (4) MOVL $57,main.autotmp_0000+40(SP) // underlying array = the new array 8048c4b 89542420 | (4) MOVL DX,main.autotmp_0000+32(SP) OK, so this is closer to Not Totally Insane, which is what we want. But why? I suppose this is either a bug or a very deep part of the compiler. In the first program, the compiler thinks it needs to compute and put into the array every item. In the second program, the compiler understands that every item is unchanging and can live in the program text.\nThough it is no longer assembling the array at runtime byte by byte, it is still calling runtime.new and then making a copy from the program text into the new array. Can we do better? If we move the array out of the function call and give it a local variable, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change anything, it is still copied (not shown, check for yourself if you want). If we move the initialization of the array out to the global scope, then the Go compiler moves it into main.init() for us, doing the copy just the same.\nSo, can we do it without the copy at all? Yes! But it requires unsafe, slice brain surgery, and Cgo. Hang on tight\u0026hellip;\nA slice is a data structure on top of an underlying zone of memory. The definition of a slice from reflect.SliceHeader is:\ntype SliceHeader struct { Data uintptr Len int Cap int } So what we want to do is get a pointer to a place in memory where our contiguous bytes are stored, then set the Data pointer of the slice to that pointer (as well as making sure Len and Cap are correct). Mucking around with pointers like this can get you in trouble: if the garbage collector decides that the only reference it has to the thing at slice.Data, and it is ready to garbage collect your slice, then it\u0026rsquo;s going to try to garbage collect your underlying array as well. If that array came from someplace other than the Go heap, you\u0026rsquo;re going to corrupt something. But it is relatively easy to prevent a slice from ever getting GC\u0026rsquo;d; all you have to do is hold it in a map at global scope. For my application (a set of byte arrays representing contents of files), I already want to hold them in a map with keys equal to the filename and values equal to the byte slice.\nI said we\u0026rsquo;d need Cgo too. But why? The answer is that if we let the Go compiler put the bytes away into the program text, it will know where they are, but we won\u0026rsquo;t. We can\u0026rsquo;t reference a symbol like \u0026ldquo;main.statictmp_0001\u0026rdquo; to find the bytes themselves. And no matter what we do when we are trying to find out where the bytes are stored, Go copies them into memory alloced with new. Why? Probably because it needs to guarantee that the array will be writeable later, since it is not marked as immutable as strings are (the fact that strings are immutable means there might be another way to achieve our goal; we\u0026rsquo;ll have to come back to that in a bit) it can\u0026rsquo;t leave the bytes pointing to the read-only memory where the program text is stored.\nSo we need Cgo not because we want to call into a C subroutine, but because we want to have C put the bytes into the read-only segment of the program text with a symbol on them that we know, and can pass to unsafe.Pointer when we are doing our slice brain surgery.\nHere is the resulting test program:\npackage main /* unsigned char const data__tmp_test_zip[] = { 0, 1, 2 }; */ import \u0026#34;C\u0026#34; import ( \u0026#34;unsafe\u0026#34; \u0026#34;reflect\u0026#34; ) var FileMap map[string][]byte func main() { FileMap = make(map[string][]byte) s1 := C.data__tmp_test_zip[:] s1x := (*reflect.SliceHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026amp;s1)) var buf [1]byte s2 := buf[:] s2x := (*reflect.SliceHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026amp;s2)) s2x.Data = s1x.Data s2x.Len = s1x.Len s2x.Cap = s1x.Cap FileMap[\u0026#34;/tmp/test.zip\u0026#34;] = s2 println(FileMap[\u0026#34;/tmp/test.zip\u0026#34;]) } In this case, we are trying to store the three bytes 0, 1, 2. We do that inside the /* */ block right before the import \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;. The slice brain surgery happens in main(). C.data__tmp_test_zip is type [3]C.uchar. To get a slice on top of it, we just ask for C.data__tmp_test_zip[:] and put it in s1. We use reflect to dig inside the slice and find the pointer to the underlying bytes.\n(Thanks to Gustavo, who showed me how to do this with his mmap module.)\nThe next part, with s2 and s2x, is a second piece of brain surgery. The underlying array is a [3]C.uchar. But we want an API based on []byte, because that way we can pass them to things like bytes.NewReader to get an io.Reader that we can pass onwards to things like image/png.Decode. To do that, we make a new slice with an underlying [1]byte array, then we swap out the pointer to point to the array of bytes the C made for us. Voila, a []byte that points to the contents of our file, without a copy.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2010/12/13/fat-constants-thin-constants/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI play from time to time with \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tinygo/\"\u003ea patch for Go that makes the Tiny runtime more capable\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026rsquo;m currently cycling between several little Go toys as I get the time. One is to make Go on raw hardware more useful/interesting. Another is a clone of the console server from conserver.com written in Go. Neither one of those little projects is at a point where I can really explain much about it, but not for want of trying\u0026hellip; This week my Go console server project taught me that netchan cannot send channels (OK, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really shocked at this, but I was hoping that it might work), and so I\u0026rsquo;ll need to make my own protocol, and include some proxy channel reader/writers at each end of the TCP connection to send the data into the channel like I want. On the raw-hardware side, I got stuck on code that ends up incorrect once it ends up in the ELF file. Go figure.\nSo though I don\u0026rsquo;t have the final answer yet, even what I know so far is at least a bit interesting, and that will be the topic of this week\u0026rsquo;s post. (Hopefully next week\u0026rsquo;s will be \u0026ldquo;I GOT IT! Here\u0026rsquo;s the solution\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. but don\u0026rsquo;t hold your breath.)\nWhen you set GOOS to \u0026ldquo;tiny\u0026rdquo;, and then rebuild the runtime, you get a runtime system that knows how to run Go code on raw hardware with no underlying OS (see $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime/tiny/README for some more info). Of course, if you try to compile something that reads a file, it will fail: there\u0026rsquo;s no kernel, let alone a filesystem. But you can write to the screen, which is nifty. I though it would be cool to add some more stuff to Go\u0026rsquo;s tiny runtime, for example a way to receive hardware interrupts over a channel. What\u0026rsquo;s really interesting about Go on raw hardware is that Go already provides a few of the things you need to write an OS (threads, scheduling, bounded arrays \u0026ndash; a form of memory protection). I\u0026rsquo;m not proposing to write \u0026ldquo;the Go OS\u0026rdquo;. But I think it would be interesting to be able to run some kinds of servers on raw hardware; if you don\u0026rsquo;t need/want an OS under you, why should you have to have one?\nSo far, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a whole heap of code to compile when GOOS=tiny, including exp/draw and all its dependencies. My current goal is to put a white rectangle onto the VGA screen using exp/draw and a new backend that I\u0026rsquo;m calling exp/draw/svga.go. But something is going wrong, I\u0026rsquo;m getting a page fault from running off into bad memory. To debug that, it\u0026rsquo;s time to set up proper trap handlers. A nifty way to do that, borrowed from Plan 9, looks like this:\nTEXT intr0(SB),7,$0 PUSHL $0 PUSHL $0 JMP intrcommon TEXT intr1(SB),7,$0 PUSHL $0 PUSHL $1 JMP intrcommon ... intrcommon: PUSHL DS PUSHL ES PUSHL FS PUSHL GS PUSHAL ... IRETL What, you don\u0026rsquo;t know assembly? Please, I think you can figure out what\u0026rsquo;s happening here, but I\u0026rsquo;ll help anyway. For each type of interrupt, we emit a bit of code that sets up the stack right, then uses a common piece of code. This is something you can do in assembly that you can\u0026rsquo;t do in Go: jumping from inside of one routine to a label inside of another one. Also, you can\u0026rsquo;t futz with specific registers and the hardware stack, which is what you have to do in an interrupt service routine, and which explains why this code is assembler and not Go code.\nWhen you run this code in Bochs and single step it, you find out what\u0026rsquo;s actually running on the processor is something more like this:\nTEXT intr0(SB),7,$0 PUSHL $0 PUSHL $0 PUSHL DS PUSHL ES PUSHL FS PUSHL GS PUSHAL ... (rest of intrcommon here) ... IRETL TEXT intr1(SB),7,$0 PUSHL $0 PUSHL $1 ... loop: JMP loop Thus if you happen to hit interrupt 0, things work ok. But if you happen to hit interrupt 1, you are stuck in endless loop hell.\nIt seemed to me like 8a was incorrectly compiling this. So I added a bunch of debugging code to it, and I convinced myself that it was working right. One problem is that there is no debugging flag to help you understand the output .8 file you get after doing \u0026ldquo;8a test.s\u0026rdquo;. If 8a is not compiling it wrong, who else could be? Well, my interrupt service routines had to make it through one other piece of code before getting on the raw hardware: 8l. The problem must be in there, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t found it yet.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s way more than my bug in 8l, however. This is really where a lot of the magic of the Go system come from. It implements the split stacks Go uses to support thousands of threads. It also implements dependency tracking, so that the right object files are pulled in to satisfy all the imports. In contrast, the C linker is traditionally implemented as a rather stupid thing that just gathers .o files together. One thing you find in libraries meant for wide reuse is that all the functions are in their own file, because cc and ld are not smart enough to exclude unneeded code from the final binary except on the level of the .o file. But not all linkers are stupid: The GNU tool chain is smarter than this, at least on some platforms. Take a look at ld-s -gc-sections options if you are interested. And this article in MSDN talks about how .NET uses link time code generation for some optimizations.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve confirmed that the instruction stream is coming into 8l correctly. The undocumented \u0026ldquo;-W\u0026rdquo; flag tells 8l to show you the contents of every .8 file it is reading. Take this little sample .s file:\nTEXT foo1(SB), 7, $0 NOP JMP bar TEXT foo2(SB), 7, $0 NOP bar: NOP RET Compile it with \u0026ldquo;8a test.s\u0026rdquo;, then look at it using \u0026ldquo;8l -W test.8\u0026rdquo;:\nANAME / ANAME home ANAME jra ANAME go ANAME src ANAME cmd ANAME 8a ANAME foo.s (1) HISTORY , (9) HISTORY , ANAME foo1 (1) TEXT foo1+0(SB),7,$0-0 (2) NOP , ANAME bar (3) JMP ,5(PC) ANAME foo2 (4) TEXT foo2+0(SB),7,$0-0 (5) NOP , (7) NOP , (8) RET , (8) END , ... and then 1000\u0026#39;s of lines of dumps from other files here... The output from -W shows that test.8 knows it is supposed to be jumping up into the next routine. My current guess at what\u0026rsquo;s happening is that 8l processes things one function at a time, never expecting dependencies between functions like this (since it is most definitely not something it should expect to be coming from 8g).\nBonus trivia nugget: The Go system defines a set of flags on functions that lets 8g and 8a communicate with 8l and tell it what to do. If a routine cannot, or should not check the stack size, then it needs to use a text line with 7 in it. If you leave out the 7, 8l will add in the stack checking code (which would be an extremely crash-worthy idea in an ISR, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?). We\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about stack checking one week when I dig into how split stacks work. For now, you can read Ian\u0026rsquo;s article on them.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2010/11/15/wheres-all-the-magic-in-the-linker/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have been trying to make a post per week about Go, but that requires learning something interesting during the week. I\u0026rsquo;m currently cycling between several little Go toys as I get the time. One is to make Go on raw hardware more useful/interesting.

Neither one of those little projects is at a point where I can really explain much about it, but not for want of trying\u0026hellip; This week my Go console server project taught me that netchan cannot send channels (OK, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really shocked at this, but I was hoping that it might work), and so I\u0026rsquo;ll need to make my own protocol, and include some proxy channel reader/writers at each end of the TCP connection to send the data into the channel like I want.

In the linker..."},{"content":"In my last post, I showed a program that had a strange behavior that caught my eye. I was trying to look at how Go handles shared access to globals, but the program also had the unintended effect of measuring the \u0026ldquo;fairness\u0026rdquo; of the Go scheduler. Here\u0026rsquo;s the program again, for context:\npackage main import \u0026#34;runtime\u0026#34; var x int var ch = make(chan bool) func f(inc int) { for { println(\u0026#34;f: \u0026#34;, inc) x += inc ch \u0026lt;- true } } func main() { go f(1) go f(-1) runtime.Gosched() for { _ = \u0026lt;- ch _ = \u0026lt;- ch println(\u0026#34;main sees x = \u0026#34;, x) } } When you run this with GOMAXPROCS=3, and you are on a machine with at least three cores, you get precisely what you\u0026rsquo;d expect: three system threads, each one running one goroutine, and total fairness: f(1) happens once for every f(-1), and the long-run value of x is around 0, but sometimes higher or lower.\nWhen you run this with GOMAXPROCS=1, you see something else. x goes to infinity because the goroutines are called in a unchanging cycle like this:\n\\* f(1)\n\\* f(1)\n\\* f(-1)\n\\* main\nTalk about two steps forward, one step back!\nNow, no one ever said life was fair, nor that the Go scheduler is fair. But in the spirit of digging down into Go more, let\u0026rsquo;s go find out why not.\nTaking a look at the assembly for main, we can see that each read on the channel results in a call into runtime.readchan1. It is this call into the runtime that causes main() to yield control to the scheduler and let the f(1), f(1), f(-1) cycle begin again, so it should be interesting. If we go take a look at that function (see $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime/chan.c) it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to understand right away how marking the sending goroutine as unblocked and ready results in the behavior we see. But this does give us a chance to talk about the Go runtime\u0026rsquo;s debugging feature, which is useful.\nThis snippet from chan.c shows how the Go runtime does debugging:\nstatic int32 debug = 0; ... void chanrecv(Hchan* c, byte *ep, bool* pres) { ... f(debug) printf(\u0026#34;chanrecv: chan=%p\\n\u0026#34;, c); Not exactly earth-shattering, I know, but this is what\u0026rsquo;s nice about Go\u0026rsquo;s code: it is the simplest possible thing that work.\nIf you change debug = 0 to debug = 1, then recompile (gomake -C $GOMAKE/src/pkg/runtime clean install) your runtime will now spam out messages about channels. This pattern works for other modules, like slices and the scheduler (found in proc.c). Once we have debugging turned on in our runtime, we recompile and relink the test program, and now we have this output:\n1: makechan: chan=0xb7f1d000; elemsize=1; elemalg=0; elemalign=1; dataqsiz=0 2: f: 1 3: chansend: chan=0xb7f1d000; elem=1 4: f: -1 5: chansend: chan=0xb7f1d000; elem=1 6: chanrecv: chan=0xb7f1d000 7: chanrecv: chan=0xb7f1d000 8: main sees x = 0 9: chanrecv: chan=0xb7f1d000 10: f: 1 11: chansend: chan=0xb7f1d000; elem=1 12: f: 1 13: chansend: chan=0xb7f1d000; elem=1 14: f: -1 15: chansend: chan=0xb7f1d000; elem=1 16: chanrecv: chan=0xb7f1d000 17: main sees x = 1 18: chanrecv: chan=0xb7f1d000 19: chanrecv: chan=0xb7f1d000 Hidden in there is the answer to our question, but we\u0026rsquo;ll have to take it line by line to find it. I have added line numbers to help talk about the output.\nIn lines 2-5, f(1) and f(-1) do their thing and then block themselves by writing to the channel. Once they are both blocked, and now that the channel has got two values waiting on it, main wakes up and receives them both (lines 6-8). In line 9, main\u0026rsquo;s just gone to sleep waiting on the channel at the top of its loop, on the second time through the loop.\nNow that main is asleep, the scheduler looks around for something to do. f(1) and f(-1) are runnable because they are no longer blocked on their channel writes. In lines 10 and 11, f(1) gets a chance to increment x, and then sends on the channel. What we expect to happen now (on average, anyway) is that f(-1) will get a chance to run. Instead f(1) gets to run again (lines 12-13). Why? Because main was already sleeping on the channel when f(1) wrote to it. Instead of being put to sleep, f(1) completes it\u0026rsquo;s write and keeps running. On the second write to the channel, it ends up asleep.\nThis points out the key lesson about unbuffered channels from this post: if the receiver is blocked on a read, and the sender does a send, he zips right through the send without yielding control to the Go scheduler.\nAfter f(1) takes the second trip through the loop and finds that the reader is now waiting to wake up on the value he wrote last time through, now he finally goes to sleep. In $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime/chan.c, in function chansend, the difference between the first time through f(1) and the second time through f(1) is the difference between the dequeue returns non-nil case and the code that follows, where a new pseudo-g is allocated and filled in, then gosched() is called, resulting in the f(1) goroutine yielding.\nThe Go runtime needs to choose the next goroutine to run. It has now got two choices, main and f(-1). It takes the routine that was marked runnable longest ago and runs it; in this case f(-1). Why? Probably to ensure that goroutines cannot be starved for time to run. f(-1) decrements and then tries to send on the channel, but is discovers that there\u0026rsquo;s no waiting channel reader (remember, f(1) filled up main\u0026rsquo;s outstanding read request before) and goes to sleep. main gets to run and reads f(1)\u0026rsquo;s first value (line 9, which happens after line 15), then it\u0026rsquo;s second (line 16). It prints, loops, finds the message from f(-1) and then goes to sleep again.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s clear that due to the behavior of writes onto channels with pending readers, this program is not doing what we wanted at all. A solution is to use two channels instead of one shared channel:\npackage main import \u0026#34;runtime\u0026#34; var x int func f(inc int, ch chan bool) { for { println(\u0026#34;f: \u0026#34;, inc) x += inc ch \u0026lt;- true } } func main() { ch1 := make(chan bool) ch2 := make(chan bool) go f(1, ch1) go f(-1, ch2) runtime.Gosched() for { _ = \u0026lt;- ch1 _ = \u0026lt;- ch2 println(\u0026#34;main sees x = \u0026#34;, x) } } The results are satisfying:\nmakechan: chan=0xb7e47000; elemsize=1; elemalg=0; elemalign=1; dataqsiz=0 makechan: chan=0xb7e477c0; elemsize=1; elemalg=0; elemalign=1; dataqsiz=0 f: 1 chansend: chan=0xb7e47000; elem=1 f: -1 chansend: chan=0xb7e477c0; elem=1 chanrecv: chan=0xb7e47000 chanrecv: chan=0xb7e477c0 main sees x = 0 chanrecv: chan=0xb7e47000 f: 1 chansend: chan=0xb7e47000; elem=1 f: 1 chansend: chan=0xb7e47000; elem=1 f: -1 chansend: chan=0xb7e477c0; elem=1 chanrecv: chan=0xb7e477c0 main sees x = 1 chanrecv: chan=0xb7e47000 chanrecv: chan=0xb7e477c0 f: -1 chansend: chan=0xb7e477c0; elem=1 f: -1 chansend: chan=0xb7e477c0; elem=1 f: 1 chansend: chan=0xb7e47000; elem=1 main sees x = 0 Note that there\u0026rsquo;s a new interesting pattern, f(1), f(1), f(-1), main, f(-1), f(-1), f(1), main. But that one will have to wait for another post, the baby wants to play\u0026hellip; :)\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2010/11/08/who-said-life-is-fair-the-go-scheduler-certainly-didnt/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my last post, I showed a program that had a strange behavior that caught my eye.

Roger\u0026rsquo;s answer was \u0026ldquo;go RTFM\u0026rdquo;, which was precisely the right thing to do. However, it took reading it twice (I\u0026rsquo;d read it before) and some hard pondering to connect what I was reading to what I was seeing.\nIn order to save you, the reader, from the same experience, here\u0026rsquo;s a more detailed explanation of how \u0026ldquo;happens before\u0026rdquo; applies to programs where coroutines are writing to and reading from globals. Disclaimer: You really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing this. In Go, you \u0026ldquo;share memory by communicating, not communicate by sharing memory\u0026rdquo;. Asking questions about \u0026ldquo;what happens when two coroutines write to a global?\u0026rdquo; means you are already thinking about communicating by sharing, and you are in for a world of hurt. But in this case, I was exploring the concurrency model in coroutines in the absence of calls into the runtime (i.e. cooperative or not?) and so I wanted to avoid channels.\nOK, on to the (broken) code:\npackage main import \u0026#34;runtime\u0026#34; var i int func f(inc int) { for { i += inc } } func main() { runtime.GOMAXPROCS(3) go f(1) go f(-1) runtime.Gosched() for j := 0; ; j++ { if (j % 1e9) == 0 { print(i, \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;) } } } The idea here is to get two uncooperative goroutines (i.e. grabbing the CPU and never giving it back) onto two cores, and then watch what happens from the third goroutine. \u0026ldquo;Watch what happens\u0026rdquo; is secret code for \u0026ldquo;communicate by sharing memory\u0026rdquo; and we\u0026rsquo;ve already established that\u0026rsquo;s a bad idea. Thus it should be no surprise to the reader at this point that the output of main is all zeros, instead of the occasional -1, -2 or 100 or whatever you might have expected.\nLooking at the assembly (using \u0026ldquo;8g -S\u0026rdquo;) we can see why main() never sees the results from f()\u0026rsquo;s work:\n--- prog list \u0026#34;f\u0026#34; --- 0000 (hog.go:7) TEXT f+0(SB),$0-4 0001 (hog.go:7) MOVL inc+0(FP),CX 0002 (hog.go:7) MOVL i+0(SB),AX 0003 (hog.go:8) JMP ,5 0004 (hog.go:8) JMP ,7 0005 (hog.go:9) ADDL CX,AX 0006 (hog.go:8) JMP ,5 0007 (hog.go:11) RET , The problem is that the global i is loaded into AX and incremented there, without ever being written back into the memory location where i came from. So main() can\u0026rsquo;t see it going up and down, because i exists in three different places, the AX for f(1), the AX for f(-1) and the global that main() is looking at.\nIs this a bug in Go\u0026rsquo;s register allocation? No, it is the result of the \u0026ldquo;happens before\u0026rdquo; analysis described in The Go Memory Model. Go read that now, you need to understand that to understand the rest\u0026hellip;\nThe examples in The Go Memory Model do not clearly cover this case, and I found it a bit hard to reason about it until I started unrolling the loops in my head so that the program looks like this:\npackage main var i int func f(inc int) { i += inc // 1 i += inc // 2 i += inc // 3 ... } func main() { go f(1); go f(-1); // in practice, you\u0026#39;d need this to get them running, but it\u0026#39;s // not important for this analysis //runtime.Gosched() println(i) // 4 println(i) // 5 ... } The happens-before relation for line 1 and line 2 is governed by the rule that inside a goroutine, program order determines happens-before. The happens-before relation for 4 and 5 are likewise defined. The problem comes when you consider the happens-before order of lines 1 and 4. It is not defined, because the only definition of happens-before that spans goroutines is that implied by sends and receives on a channel.\nIn fact, by adding a channel to the program, you can make the register assignment I originally complained about go away because you are fixing the happens-before order to be something that the Go compiler can only guarantee by writing to a global and not to a register:\npackage main import \u0026#34;runtime\u0026#34; var x int var ch = make(chan bool) func f(inc int) { for { x += inc ch \u0026lt;- true println(\u0026#34;f: \u0026#34;, inc) } } func main() { go f(1) go f(-1) runtime.Gosched() for { _ = \u0026lt;- ch println(x) } } Looking at f() in assembly now gives the right answer:\n--- prog list \u0026#34;f\u0026#34; --- 0000 (hog8.go:8) TEXT f+0(SB),$24-4 0001 (hog8.go:9) JMP ,3 0002 (hog8.go:9) JMP ,23 0003 (hog8.go:10) MOVL inc+0(FP),BX 0004 (hog8.go:10) ADDL BX,x+0(SB) ... send on channel is here, not interesting for our needs ... 0022 (hog8.go:9) JMP ,3 0023 (hog8.go:14) RET , Notice how the compiler realized that, because there is a channel send coming up, that the add must happen out in memory (ADDL BX,x+0(SB)) and not in the register as before.\nThis program uncovers a new strange behavior, however. With GOMAXPROCS=1, it runs f(1),f(1),f(-1),main in a loop, resulting in i incrementing without bound. With GOMAXPROCS=3, it does the expected thing, where i stays around zero, but sometimes goes up and down. I will try looking into that little mystery another time, stay tuned!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2010/11/01/whats-happening-here-and-when/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA while ago, I \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/4f27c88adbf3a10b/88d8a6beea206f62\"\u003eposted\u003c/a\u003e to the Go users list about what seemed like a problem in how Go was choosing registers versus global variables.

In it, I wanted to explore how it might work to create a giant \u0026ldquo;onion\u0026rdquo; of threads, passing messages in towards the center, where they would be reflected and sent back out. Why? Just for fun, to solidify my grasp on the syntax, to see what would happen.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my program:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; ) func make2() (chan int, chan int) { return make(chan int), make(chan int) } func makeAndEcho(ct int, in, out chan int) { var in2, out2 chan int; echo := func () { for !closed(in) { x := \u0026lt;-in out \u0026lt;- x } } pass := func () { for !closed(in) { select { case x := \u0026lt;-in: { in2 \u0026lt;- x } case x := \u0026lt;-out2: { out \u0026lt;- x } } } } if (ct == 0) { go echo() } else { in2, out2 = make2() makeAndEcho(ct-1, in2, out2) go pass() } } func try(depth, n int) { in, out := make2() makeAndEcho(depth, in, out) before := time.Nanoseconds() for i := 0; i \u0026lt; n; i++ { in \u0026lt;- 1 _ = \u0026lt;- out } close(in) after := time.Nanoseconds() transits := int64(n*depth*2) fmt.Printf( \u0026#34;%v round-trips, %v nsec/trip, %v nsec/transit for %v transits\\n\u0026#34;, n, (after-before)/int64(n), (after-before)/int64(transits), transits); } func main() { try(10, 10000) try(100, 10000) ch := make(chan int, 1) before := time.Nanoseconds() for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 200000; i++ { ch \u0026lt;- i _ = \u0026lt;- ch } after := time.Nanoseconds() fmt.Printf( \u0026#34;no threads: %v nsec/transit for %v transits\\n\u0026#34;, (after-before)/200000, 200000) } When you run it, you get this:\n10000 round-trips, 26794 nsec/trip, 1339 nsec/transit for 200000 transits 10000 round-trips, 256800 nsec/trip, 1284 nsec/transit for 2000000 transits no threads: 170 nsec/transit for 200000 transits So, what does that mean? Two things jump out: (1) the time per channel transit is lower for the deeply nested onion, and (2) the time per transit across threads is 10 times the time per transit across a channel that\u0026rsquo;s in the same thread. A quick guess why on the first one is that the more deeply nested onion triggers the same number of GC\u0026rsquo;s, so the overhead is spread over more transits, and makes each transit appear to be cheaper. I would have to investigate GCs more, and find out how to turn them off to check their impact.\nAnother thing that would be interesting would be to time the setup and teardown and understand if it goes up linearly with the number of channels. And how do you time the teardown? Timing the close(in) wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it, you\u0026rsquo;d need to time from the close to when the final \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m closed\u0026rdquo; message arrives on the out channel. (This part of Go is a bit messy. I was confused to find these random nil messages arriving on my channels when I was playing with another program.)\nThis little thing does not argue any particular point; not that threads are expensive, nor that channels are. It\u0026rsquo;s just interesting to see that this works, and that Go is able to handle a hundred threads that are all communicating with each other with no sweat.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2010/10/12/go-fun-the-cost-of-threads/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s a little program I wrote in Go.

store data.\u0026rdquo; It was a strange class, because it mixed theory and practice in a way that was anathema to the way I think. The theory part bored me to tears, and seemed ludicrously useless (first normal form? third normal form? who cares!). The practice part seemed ridiculously complicated and pointless. Why go to all that effort to write something down? Why not just write it? Yes, yes, I know, ACID and all that. I grudgingly learned it all, and I passed the class. But it never felt right to me.

It didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like Theory of Computing (i.e. Turing machines, regular expressions, the halting problem, etc), which just Felt Right.\nSo, you can imagine that it warms my heart immensely to read about NoSQL, a growing backlash against SQL/ACID data management.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s especially heart-warming about the backlash is that it\u0026rsquo;s coming from honest to god working computer scientists, not the academics, and not some bussinessmen who are trying to move SQL aside for their own profit. This is simply the next evolution of how to think about storing data: there are ways to process data where ACID is not a useful feature, and you need to have tools in your toolbox that respect that reality.\nPS: A particularly philisophical reader might notice that I\u0026rsquo;m commenting here on the fundamental difference between the mathematics of computers and software engineering. Where the mathematicians lead us, the path (though steep and rocky) is usually an interesting trip. Where the software engineers lead us sometimes takes us into the malarial swamps of SQL. And the artisans of software, those who rightly reject the clunky boots and balky toolbelts that the software engineers wear?

Like making every post into a big PDF and sending it off to a print-on-demand service. Digital backups = bad. Paper backups = good.\nI thought it would be easy, just do \u0026ldquo;Wordpress export\u0026rdquo;, then write the XSLT to turn the export XML file into FO, and process into PDF. Well, it is easy, in principle. But in practice it\u0026rsquo;s not.\nThe first problem is that posts have HTML in them. Not a lot. It\u0026rsquo;s almost entirely in-line stuff, like bold and italics. But it\u0026rsquo;s there, and you have to format it. Which means that you have to get it into the XML document tree so that XSLT can walk the tree and convert the HTML into FO one tag at a time. (By the way, a great resource on how to do the HTML to FO is at IBM developerWorks.)\nBut the problem is that Wordpress exports blog entries using the content:encoded tag, with the stuff inside that tag is a CDATA string. Which means that your XSLT processor gets the chunk of HTML as a string, and not as nodes in the XML tree, which means you can\u0026rsquo;t process it. But if you pull off the CDATA and send the Wordpress version of the blog posts directly into your XML parser, bad things happen. It\u0026rsquo;s not valid XHTML, so you can\u0026rsquo;t process it. Lots and lots of error messages, like 20000 for my blog.\nAnd like that, like a flash of lightening, I finally understood what all the fuss is about XHTML, etc. Data has to start structured so that if you want to process it later, you won\u0026rsquo;t have to clean it up. Duh.\nThe first step is to hack your Wordpress so that export does not hide the XHTML inside of a CDATA.

Why? Here\u0026rsquo;s the rundown:\nYou have to filter out all the auto-saves that Wordpress maintains in the database. I was lazy and broke the author filtering when I made my hack. YMMV. You have to add some namespaces so that your XML parser does not flip out. You have to remove the CDATA thingie. Even once you have the XHTML outside the CDATA, there\u0026rsquo;s two more layers of problems, actually. First is that Wordpress has a set of filters it uses to turn the simple input it allows into HTML, by doing stuff like adding the \u0026rsquo;s for you, etc. So you need to get that filter to trigger during your export. To do that, you use the following plugin:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Plugin Name: XHTML Export Version: 1.0 Plugin URI: http://nella.org Description: Insures output is XHTML Author: Jeff R. Allen Author URI: http://nella.org Disclaimer: This Plugin comes with no warranty, expressed or implied */ function xhtml_export( $content ) { $content = apply_filters(\u0026#39;the_content\u0026#39;, $content); // there\u0026#39;s another way to do this: see start of the stylesheet from IBM developerWorks $content = str_replace(\u0026#39;\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026amp;#160;\u0026#39;, $content); return $content; } add_filter( \u0026#39;the_excerpt_export\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;xhtml_export\u0026#39; ); add_filter( \u0026#39;the_content_export\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;xhtml_export\u0026#39; ); ?\u0026gt; Put that into your wp-content/plugins directory, then go to your plugins page and activate it.\nThe output of the Wordpress filtering step is XHTML, so if you never ever resort to the HTML tab to hack at the HTML yourself, you\u0026rsquo;d be OK. But I do that a lot, and I also imported posts from Movable Type, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t as XHTML-aware back in the day. So I still had a massive mess on my hands. Lots and lots of XML errors.\nRight about this time, in flies HTML Tidy to save the day. It can turn HTML into XHTML pretty reliably. And the Tidy-up plugin for Wordpress arranges for Tidy to do its work on each of your posts in turn and makes it super-easy to edit the posts and fix the problems.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s how far I have gotten so far. I have a tidy blog, I have a big file called blog.xml which is valid XML, including all the XHTML children nodes of the content:encoded node. Now I am hacking away on the XSLT to turn the blog into FO to make a beautiful book. As I\u0026rsquo;m not a designer, that\u0026rsquo;s the part where things fall apart for me. But I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to find a nice design template from Lulu or someone and follow that.\nAlso\u0026hellip; Tidy is also useful if you are trying to debug your FO output. Use a Makefile like this so that the error messages you get from FOP will have line numbers you can go look at instead of character offsets into the one long line that your XSLT processor emits. Tidy stupidly defaults to non-UTF8, even when you tell it it is reading an XML file, and even when the XML file has the right encoding named. So be sure to use the -utf8 flag. And don\u0026rsquo;t forget the -q flag, which shuts up the stupid advertisement the Tidy developers saw fit to put in their software. (Hello, W3C people? Yeah, we don\u0026rsquo;t care. Shut up. Thanks. okloveyabye.)\nall: view view: blog.pdf gnome-open $\u0026lt; blog.fo: blog.xml rss-to-fop.xslt xsltproc --output $@ rss-to-fop.xslt $\u0026lt; blog.fob: blog.fo tidy -utf8 -q -i -xml -o $@ $\u0026lt; blog.pdf: blog.fob fop -fo $\u0026lt; $@ clean: rm -f blog.fob blog.fo blog.pdf ","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/06/17/printing-a-blog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI got interested in applying my new XSLT wizardry to the task of printing an entire blog.

In their defense, it seems like this is also braindeadness in the FO spec, beacuse I found a commercial implementation of FO that says you have to resort to special extension namespaces to specify metadata in their implementation.

Everything post-SGML = slightly less bad. Farther from SGML is better (thus Relax NG compact = best). How to load your schema into your editor. (Tip: C-C C-S C-F for nXML) XSLT (which is the ugliest, stupidest, most verbose language ever foisted by computer science on users) How to use XInclude to build up XML documents from pieces. Don\u0026rsquo;t skimp on this. Figure it out and use it, because the alternative is the supreme ugliness that is SGML external entities. Remember: SGML = bad, XML = slightly less bad. How to make your XSLT processor work (and which of the 12 to choose \u0026ndash; go with xsltproc, it\u0026rsquo;s super fast and stable, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t care which exact point release of Java you have.

The profits come from the externalities of burning high-sulfur gasoline (decreased longevity due to sulfur-rich smog) None of this is precisely against the law.

The bottom line is the Gates Foundation does not come out looking too good, seemingly interested in whizbang gadgets and not in focusing on the job at hand. Another really interesting and sad note was the extent to which being nearby the Gates Foundation, geographically or culturally gets you in the money. PATH and the University of Washington raked in the cash. African researchers? Not so much.\nAt the same time, the Lancet published an editorial and a commentary. Of course, being academics, you know the knives are going to come out and some serious backstabbing is going to happen. (\u0026ldquo;They fight so hard because the stakes are so low.\u0026rdquo; Sigh.) They saved the really rude things for the editorial, a particularly cowardly form of academic infighting, as that way no one has to put their name on the insults. At least the commentary is signed, though in keeping with the fact they will be held accountable for their words, they are much more restrained.\nThe thing that most pissed me off about the Lancet\u0026rsquo;s editorial is the stuff about transparency. They whine and moan about how the Gates Foundation didn\u0026rsquo;t come ask them what to do. You know what, all you Masters of the Public Health Universe? You had your chance. You wasted 100 fucking years, and things just got worse and worse. Some of you were wanking, writing useless papers. Some of you were too busy teaching the next generation of wankers to go out and find out what its like to be poor. The rest of you were on public health tourism packages, in business class and five star hotels. There are no poor people in the Addis Ababa Sheraton\u0026hellip; except the waiters, but you don\u0026rsquo;t notice them anyway, I suppose.\nIf the Gates Foundation wants to know what works, the only way to know is to go ask the people doing it, those laboring in obscurity in tiny, underfunded local NGOs, and those laboring in sweaty, dirty, dangerous, uncomfortable places with overfunded and overexposed NGOs like MSF.\nAs for the commentary, it\u0026rsquo;s major point (made three times over, according to my underlines on the copy I read on the bus) is that the Gates Foundation should be investing in putting into practice things that we already know work, instead of whizbang things for the future. The whizzy MPH speak for this is \u0026ldquo;service delivery\u0026rdquo;: i.e. making sure the pharmacy wasn\u0026rsquo;t cleaned out by thieves the night before the sick baby arrives in the ambulance that someone remembered to put fuel into.\nI would be amenable to this argument, except that we already know why service delivery is so bad. It\u0026rsquo;s because a few people in this world are corrupt assholes, and something is wrong with the cultures where service delivery is bad that lets the corrupt assholes ruin things for those who just want to be healthy. The fact that people are corrupt assholes is not a problem. England has plenty of corrupt assholes (in fact, they seem to be in charge of the parliament here), but the NHS keeps running anyway. In Switzerland every year there are probably two or three doctors who lose their license for insurance fraud, billing for stuff they didn\u0026rsquo;t do. What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between the corrupt assholes in Switzerland and places where service delivery is failing patients? It\u0026rsquo;s good governance and accountability.\nEven a short little career in humanitarian aid like I have had can make you cynical, and I\u0026rsquo;ll freely admit I am cynical. But I see hope everywhere I look, too. Good people trying to make their health system work get torn down by the system, and the system is made of a thousand corrupt assholes, from big corruption (the Minister of Health of Uganda for example) all the way down to little corruption (the numerous minor staff problems we faced every single week in Saclepea, Liberia).\nThe answer is that people won\u0026rsquo;t be healthy until they and their neighbors take responsibility to make a health system that works. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how much the Lancet whines to the Gates Foundation, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter what the Gates Foundation invests in anyway. The demand for healthy communities needs to come from educated, organized, and disciplined communities. Whatever helps get us there, we should invest in. Whatever is unrelated to that is a distraction and not an ethical use of time and money.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/05/13/gates-foundation-vs-the-lancet/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Lancet has published \u003ca href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60571-7/fulltext\"\u003ean academic paper\u003c/a\u003e analyzing the deployment of funds at the Gates Foundation against a backdrop of the actual burden of disease.

The ROSCA is known as a \u0026ldquo;sou-sou\u0026rdquo; in west Africa, or at least in Nimba county, Liberia. Sousous run for a fixed term, based on the number of members. If there are 10 members and the contribution is $10, each month one of the members will get $90 (9 other members * $10 each). At the end of ten months, the sousou can either be restarted, or the membership can be renegotiated (for example, to drop people who failed to pay on time during the past sousou period). If the sousou is reconstituted with more or fewer people, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really change anything, it just runs shorter or longer until the next restart. Sousous run best when they are between 6 and 12 people for social and economic reasons (a 5x - 11x payoff is manageable in a cash society). The order of the payouts is determined randomly at the startup meeting of the sousou. Sometimes people negotiate to trade their places in the payout order in order to assure that the sousou payout would arrive at a time that was convenient for them.\nOne thing Vasco forgot to mention about it is the very powerful social aspect to village finance. In a village environment, saving face is important. Failing to be a reliable member in a sousou is a pretty embarrassing. But the worse punishment comes when people are invited to the next sousou, and you are excluded. People who are trustworthy get the benefits of a community savings scheme, and those who don\u0026rsquo;t are excluded. Tough, but transparent. Those excluded from a sousou this time might get another chance with another sousou later. The basic fabric of village life means that everyone has a chance at redemption.\nThe proceeds of social investment in Nimba are used for things like concrete floors and new roofs. Some richer guys planned on buying a car by combining savings from their salary over the year and their sousou windfall. Then they paid their brother to drive it, making a small foundation of a family taxi company. Others would arrange for their sousou windfall to come in the same month as their vacation, so they could use the money to buy cement and work full time on a second house. After two or three years of this trick, using sousou windfalls every six months or so to advance construction, they\u0026rsquo;d be landlords \u0026ndash; and that\u0026rsquo;s the real secret to getting rich in Liberia. (To be clear: landlords benefit from a transfer of wealth, they do not actually make new wealth by producing something. So it\u0026rsquo;s relative prosperity, not global GDP growth.)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s are some added systems that some sousous I learned about used. One had a loan concept, where members who wanted to be moved to the head of the line had to pay higher amounts in ($12 instead of $10) with the \u0026ldquo;interest\u0026rdquo; being accumulated into a long-term reserve pool. The reserve pool would then be paid out at the dissolution of the sousou to the non-borrowing members. Another sousou, this one with a large reserve after years of continuous operation, included a \u0026ldquo;compulsory loan month\u0026rdquo; in August. Each member was compelled to take a loan in August and to spend it in the local economy. He had to pay back this loan, and his normal sousou contribution during the rest of the year. They explained to me that the compulsory loan was intended to create demand in the local marketplace at a time when the local shopkeepers were normally seeing lower than average sales. Another sousou arranged their payout schedule to defer some of the normal payouts until December, to help buy Christmas presents.\nAs an aside\u0026hellip; the business of a eastern Congolese motoman is interesting as well. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the figures anymore, but it was a very tidy little business. I think the motocycle buyer could get his investment 100% paid off in 9 months by renting the moto to a motoman, and then for the remaining 3 year life of the motorcycle, he made $25 a month \u0026ldquo;moto rent\u0026rdquo;, and the motoman (usually a younger relative) got a steady job driving the motorcycle. The only problem was competition. In east congo, the business case for motos is blindingly obvious, and the right conditions exist: reliable supply of cheap chinese motos and parts from the port in Mombasa, capital ready to invest, and roads that are hostile to more comfortable cars. So there are 10 motos for every customer. The price does not collapse, because it tracks the running costs (gasoline) closely. Instead the weekly wage of a moto driver collapses, because the moto owners still demand their rent, no matter how bad competition gets.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/05/08/community-finance-in-west-africa/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eVasco Pyjama \u003ca href=\"http://vasco-pyjama.livejournal.com/233192.html\"\u003etalks about community finance\u003c/a\u003e.

The problem of \u0026ldquo;self advancement\u0026rdquo; is a serious one for Europeans, and particularly for Swiss, who see themselves as coming from very small cantons deep in the middle of a very small country (the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re just a bunch of farmers\u0026rdquo; effect). There are some Swiss people who look down on those who seek to improve themselves. There are some who criticize their neighbors when they travel too far, or study too much. Entrepreneurialism is much more rare in Europe. The most active, engaged, and entrepreneurial Europeans I have ever met live in Silicon Valley. They have to escape, they can\u0026rsquo;t imagine a life stuck in the rank and file of Siemens biding their time until they get a turn to be a boss and have a tiny bit of control.\nAt the same time I\u0026rsquo;m coming to understand what real social welfare is, Marina is coming to understand what the freedom to dream is, and what it feels like when any dream (big or small) is met with \u0026ldquo;Great!

We don\u0026rsquo;t know when and how. Something\u0026rsquo;s coming out of Mexico (though the index case might have been someplace else, too soon to tell). Is this the Big One, the pandemic that we are overdue for?\nI am gathering information here to make sure I understand it, and how to protect myself and my family.\nAvian influenza is influenza type A, subtype H5N1. The porcine influenza found in Mexico is type A, subtype H1N1. Influenza type B is much less dangerous, but is unfortunately not what we are dealing with here. The 1918 pandemic was type A, subtype H1N1 \u0026ndash; the same that is circulating in Mexico today. Matching subtypes does not mean that there\u0026rsquo;s matching virulence, but it\u0026rsquo;s a clear danger sign.\nThere are two medecines of interest.\nZanamivir, trade name Relenza (no generics available). A neuraminidase inhibitor. Must be administered by inhaler. Some evidence it is more effective than tamiflu, but little work has been done, for some reason Tamiflu gets all the press.\nOseltamivir, trade name Tamiflu. An orally active neuraminidase inhibitor. It is maintained in huge stockpiles by governments as a hedge against avian flu. Cases are already being treated with it, there is no public info I saw on its effectivness. A friend told me according to info he saw (don\u0026rsquo;t know if it was public or not) the virus responds to Tamiflu.\nBoth drugs are effective against Type A and Type B.\nWord on the street from Mexico is panicy and points to a long development of the situation and underestimation in public pronouncements. This is expected and normal. The quesiton is what to do about it? Later, there will be finger pointing (or none at all \u0026ndash; China and WHO have avoided scrutinty of their massive underreporting of the true impact of SARS, likely 10x or more the official counts). Right now, people have to decide what to do with the early, partial, bad information. One of the courses of action is \u0026ldquo;nothing out of the ordinary\u0026rdquo;, which is by default what we are all doing. The fact that Mexico is in full emergency, the USA has just declared an emergency, and the WHO has declared this an event of international concern means it\u0026rsquo;s probably time to stop the ordinary.\nMy life is already blessedly empty of large gatherings of people (I\u0026rsquo;m a geek, we don\u0026rsquo;t do people). Each day I choose whether to go to the office or not, and maybe now I\u0026rsquo;ll start to prefer home, until I know more. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll walk and use taxis instead of the bus, seems like a simple way to reduce exposure to sick people.\nTamiflu is only available in the UK with doctor\u0026rsquo;s orders, it seems. There are online pharmacies that ask you a bunch of questions, then send the questions to a doctor, who will supposedly \u0026ldquo;review\u0026rdquo; the answers, then release the drugs to you for sale. What a sleazy loophole, online pharmacies. I wonder who those doctors are, and how they sleep at night.\nFinally, to put it in perspective a bit. The pandemic of 1918 had peak fatalities of less than 25% of each affected community. I can live with odds of 1 in 4, though it\u0026rsquo;s a bit grim. With modern medicine, the case fatality rate for this outbreak will undoubtedly be much lower, and the attack rate of the virus is likely to be either in the same range as 1918, or lower (why? there\u0026rsquo;s an upper bound to how virulent a virus can be; humans are not machines, we have huge differences in our biology, and getting sick requires all the biology works just right).\nThe real problem with pandemic is economic and travel disruption. I think it is likely that there will be some. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that travel restrictions will come into effect. Hopefully they will not prevent us from receiving our guests for our wedding. But if it happens, it happens. Sad, but the party will go on, at least inside of Switzerland.\nInteresting links:\nUS government tweets on pandemic flu! CDC site on it A Google Map on suspected and confirmed cases Interesting blog that\u0026rsquo;s following the situation. The lady makes her own analyses of the threat level, which is interesting. A homemade mask, proposed by University of Pittsburgh researchers, tested rigorously, and published by the CDC. Nice balanced article from The Economist Here\u0026rsquo;s a typical example of how governments cover up and downplay outbreaks (or just confuse themselves and end up lying on accident). On the front page of Pandemic.gov, the US pandemic stage is listed as 0. When you click on it, you find the definitions (very good information design, I might add). The definitions seem to indicate that the US should either be in phase 0, 1, or 4. But apparently US phase 4 requires WHO to get to phase 6. What\u0026rsquo;s strange is that the US phases do not take into consideration the possibility that the US could be part of the initial wave of countries as it seems to be. So pretty much life as usual\u0026hellip; you prepare and then the plans all go out the window because nature does whatever she wants anyway. :)\nUpdate: It was fun to educate myself, but now I\u0026rsquo;m going back to my regularly scheduled blissful ignorace. Looks to me like smart people are managing a large but not dangerous outbreak correctly, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing for me to do but be happy that they are doing their job.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/04/27/is-this-the-big-one/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe know that a pandemic is coming.

What\u0026rsquo;s incredible is that NPR\u0026rsquo;s Channa Jaffe Walt managed to get a CEO of a shipping company on the phone and hear the inside story of the negotiations.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s really interesting. The first thing the CEO says is, \u0026ldquo;I never thought for a moment that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to pay anything.

You pay.\u0026rdquo;\nI found it really interesting to compare that to humanitarian kidnappings, where paying a ransom is theoretically not allowed (though we know it happens sometimes), and even if it does happen it is a very very very last resort. For a shipping company, paying a ransom is the first resort! That\u0026rsquo;s the difference between water and land, between diplomacy and business. And how much safer and more pleasant it is for the hostages. I\u0026rsquo;m not making this up: I\u0026rsquo;ve read excerpts from a book by a former French pirate hostage, and I worked with a former MSF hostage. The hostages of the pirates have it easy, sleeping in their own beds, eating their own food, usually with constant communication to their families, and detention measured in weeks not months. Compare that to the story of Pilar Bauza (7 days sleeping under the stars, walking 100 km, little food and water) or Arjan Erkel (20 months of captivity with almost no communication).\nFurther, it would be interesting to know what the statistical measures are for survivability and psychological and physical comfort of hostages in the petroleum business versus humanitarians (both on land, but way more money at play for oil workers).\nFinally, why is it the pirates manage to safely board ships without killing anyone, but humanitarians are sometimes killed before they are captured and ransomed?\nAll of which makes me wonder, what would it take, what fundamental change to put humanitarian aid hostages into the same relatively safer category as pirate hostages? Why do we get the shaft? (As usual, follow the money, and there you will find the answer.)\nOther really incredible stuff from the story:\nThe ransom payers delivered an electric counter (complimentary, no less!) to try to speed the ship release process. Even so, the pirates counted and/or argued among themselves for 30 hours. They keep timesheets so they know how much to pay each class of pirate! There\u0026rsquo;s a supposition that the minimum wage for a unskilled guard on a captured boat is USD 1000, twice the average family income in Somalia. The attackers, who board the ship, make many thousands more. The likely payoff for the underwriter is around 200% with a turnaround of less than one year. Try getting that from Wall Street! There\u0026rsquo;s a delicate balance at work where the holder on the monopoly (the ship) needs to keep the ransoms in check lest they get too high and prompt the ships to defend themselves better such that the pirates lose their monopoly on the commodity.

The result will be a document. I want to publish it in several formats, including HTML, PDF, and Word. (Hot tip: if you rename a RTF file to end in DOC, you\u0026rsquo;re done. Don\u0026rsquo;t make DOC files, they suck. Make RTF files, which any editor can read. You just have to trick your users and Word into using RTF\u0026rsquo;s by renaming them.)\nThe accepted standard these days for formatting a document into PDF, RTF and HTML is DocBook. In fact, the modern implementation of DocBook is just \u0026ldquo;XML + XSL (+ FO)\u0026rdquo;. You could do pretty much the same thing with XML and XSL yourself, but then your document would not be compatible with someone else\u0026rsquo;s formatting instructions, and you\u0026rsquo;d be redoing a bunch of work other people already did.\nSo DocBook is interesting, but by default it was making my document ugly. Really, really ugly. I just had to do something about it, and that lead me into playing with fonts and layout. Fonts went easy, because there\u0026rsquo;s really good info in DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide. Farting around finding free TTF fonts was a pain in the butt, but I eventually paired Futura with Garamond, on the advice of the nifty (and niftily named) Esperfonto.\nSince I was obsessing about the way the page looked, I decided it would be nice to turn on whatever magic DocBook has available to make printed pages look nice. After all, if DocBook is good enough for O\u0026rsquo;Reilly, it ought to be good enough for me. I\u0026rsquo;d already noticed that DocBook was making my quotes curve (as long as you use the hideously verbose tags). Then I looked into getting my apostrophes to curve.\nHello? Tap tap. Is this thing on?\nTurns out the number one rule of the DocBook Club is you don\u0026rsquo;t talk about the DocBook Club. There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of mailing lists and stuff, but there are no answers. Eventually, it seemed to me the actual answer is \u0026ldquo;insert the Unicode symbol for them yourself\u0026rdquo;.\nWow, that\u0026rsquo;s seriously fucking stupid. Not even Word is that stupid\u0026hellip; and I thought Word had the market cornered on stupid.\nSo I gave up on curved apostrophes for a bit and went to go turn on ligatures. Since you are probably like me and don\u0026rsquo;t know your ligatures from your descenders, check out this great picture:\nClick on the picture to go learn more. It\u0026rsquo;s a great website \u0026ndash; lots of typo geekery and puns\u0026hellip; my kind of stuff. There\u0026rsquo;s also cool stuff on ligatures there.\nSo after much gnashing of teeth and experimenting, here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m coming to see about DocBook, PDF and HTML:\nLigatures work, and can be quite beautiful.\nLigatures make searching in the PDF document fail mysteriously, because the underlying word is gone, and what remains are the characters that get displayed. \u0026ldquo;Difficult\u0026rdquo; is a different word than \u0026ldquo;Di ffi-ligature cult\u0026rdquo;. Because PDF is all about the flash, no one has gotten around to fixing this. It would take rocket science. What needed to happen was about 20 years ago someone should have stood up and said, \u0026ldquo;wait! words are words, and instructions for showing words are not words, and when the two are different, both have to be preserved!\u0026rdquo;. And in fact, MacOS seems to have this\u0026hellip; watch this video to see that Macs can add ligatures \u0026ldquo;on top of\u0026rdquo; underlying text without forgetting what the text itself is:\nUsing typographic ligature on Mac OS X from Cédric Hüsler on Vimeo.\nLigatures don\u0026rsquo;t work with all fonts. That makes them tricky to use in PDF (but doable) and really dangerous to do in HTML (where there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee what font you\u0026rsquo;ll get).\nDocBook has no support whatsoever for ligatures, just as support is absent for curved apostrophes. It just boils down to \u0026ldquo;type the Unicode\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, now I\u0026rsquo;m contemplating one of two ways forward:\nJust forget them all together, which would be a shame Write a script called \u0026ldquo;ligify\u0026rdquo; that finds all the ligatures and puts them in, and only let it run for the PDF generation, not the HTML generation. (Bad interactions between nXML mode and XML\u0026rsquo;s stupid macros mean I already have to do my own macro expansion with sed anyway.) I\u0026rsquo;m becoming an expert in DocBook publishing, which would be a nice thing to have on my resume, except that I fear I\u0026rsquo;d slit my wrists if I was doing this stuff every day. How can it be that SGML has existed 20 years, and it\u0026rsquo;s STILL THIS BAD? This is clearly an example of Leonard\u0026rsquo;s Law (software will be as bad as its users will tolerate).\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/04/09/my-life-in-docbook-ligature-hell/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am working on a new project.

You need to install the right drivers so that you can talk to your phone with the USB cable. The lightest weight way to do this is put in the CD-ROM that came with the phone, then cancel out of the autorun crap from 3. Plug in the phone, and use Windows Plug and Pray\u0026rsquo;s UI in advanced mode to load the drivers in the USD drivers directory of the CD-ROM. You have to do the whole thing 4 times, because the phone presents itself on the USB bus in four different ways. Each time you have to agree that you are installing an unsigned driver (because Amoi was too cheap to get them signed). By using Windows to install the drivers, you get only the drivers and not the other 200 megs of crap on the CD.\nNext, you start up DC Unlocker. Tell it you have an Amoi phone, and let it auto-detect it. When it sees your phone, you are ready to pay (at this point you can be confident you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to unlock it). You click \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Buy credit\u0026rdquo;, then buy 10 credits for your WP-S1. You have to go find the right number of credits for other phones. (Too bad DC Unlocker doesn\u0026rsquo;t do this itself.) Ignore all the hooha about dongles and value packs, etc. That\u0026rsquo;s for the professional unlockers. Just buy 10 credits. They take paypal. Quick, easy, and safe.\nBack in DC Unlocker, click on \u0026ldquo;Server\u0026rdquo; and use the new username and password you just made. You\u0026rsquo;ll see your 10 credits. Click on \u0026ldquo;Unlock\u0026rdquo;, then \u0026ldquo;Unlock phone\u0026rdquo;. Wait a bit, and you\u0026rsquo;re done.\nThis is painless and cheaper than the guys in the shops (who are likely doing the same thing anyway, but charging a markup on it).

All at once!\nkc wrote a blog posting with her humble ideas on how to use IP address space tax. Wait\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s a tax on address space? Yes, because it has become a scare quantity, because people are too lazy to move to IPv6, IPv4 address space is running out. The best of all bad ideas about what to do about this is to make an open market for address space, as though network addresses were some kind of useful piece of property with any kind of useful value. (BTW: When the present econolypse is over, and the next bubble starts, it will be an IPv4 address space bubble. Mark my words\u0026hellip;) Address space is bits. We can make more bits\u0026hellip; Look! I just made some! But because the value of a network exists in everyone who is using it, not just your implementation of the network, you can\u0026rsquo;t just add bits in your IP stack and get any benefit. So, while bits are free, and address space could conceiveably be free, because we have a network with limited space, we have a scarce asset. And, of course, what do humans do with scarce assets? We make bubbles! Yay for bubbles!\nOK, now that we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten kc and tech checked off the list for this post, what about economics? Well, actually I touched on economics above, but there\u0026rsquo;s something way more fundamental to economics. Fundamental questions tend to be hard to recognize because they seem so obvious. The world would be a lot more sane place if more people took the time to ask this particular question and understand (no\u0026hellip; really understand) the answer:\nWhat is money?\nIn case you are not following me and don\u0026rsquo;t see why this is a hard question, see if any of these wrong/incomplete answers are floating in your head:\nMoney is the paper with green ink and dead guys on it. And red discs with the other dead guy on them, but it takes 100 of those red discs to make one of the green papers. Money is dollars, euros, and yen. It\u0026rsquo;s what you spend when you want to buy something. You can change it to the other kind of money if there\u0026rsquo;s a different symbol in front of the price on the thing you want to buy. Money comes from the government. The Fed sets the rate and it goes into banks, then I get it from the ATM. These answers are all wrong. Not just a little bit wrong\u0026hellip; they are like \u0026ldquo;the earth is flat\u0026rdquo; wrong, or \u0026ldquo;the sun goes around the earth\u0026rdquo; wrong.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the answer? I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you what\u0026hellip; the answer is so hard that I certainly can\u0026rsquo;t tell you. You could earn two PhD\u0026rsquo;s and not really know. Money is something that humans invented after we invented trade, but before we invented numbers. That means it\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s fundamental in the human condition, and that it is as human as culture and art. You might as well give up on the money question and work on a nice simple one like, \u0026ldquo;What is art?\u0026rdquo;.\nBut it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be very nice of me to bring you this far and dump you with no ideas of what money is. What lead me to write this post is this great quote I found in one of the papers kc linked to in her blog posting. Here\u0026rsquo;s the quote:\nThe Nature of Money\nMy very great teachers (Alchian, 1977; Brunner and Meltzer, 1971) taught that a society uses as money that entity that economizes best on the use of other real resources to gather information about relative prices and to conduct transactions. This makes clear that the common \u0026ndash; but wrong \u0026ndash; statement of Gresham\u0026rsquo;s Law about \u0026ldquo;bad money\u0026rdquo; driving out \u0026ldquo;good money\u0026rdquo; needs to be restated. What we have observed through the millennia is that high-confidence monies drive out low-confidence monies (Hayek, 1976, p. 29; Mundell, 1998).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s academic speak, and it\u0026rsquo;s easier to understand if you read it in context. But what it\u0026rsquo;s basically saying is that \u0026ldquo;a culture will chose as money that thing which minimizes the costs for them to participate in the market to find the correct price for goods\u0026rdquo;.\nThat is profound. It\u0026rsquo;s very far removed from what we think about money when we are at the checkout counter at Tesco (which for me is usually \u0026ldquo;Gee, this yogurt will be 37 pence, I hope I have exact change and can make my pocket lighter\u0026rdquo;).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a related story from when I worked as an administrator in Liberia for Doctors Without Borders. A rumor was going around the country that \u0026ldquo;little head\u0026rdquo; dollars were no longer accepted by the bank. \u0026ldquo;Little head\u0026rdquo; dollars? This is Liberian shorthand to describe the difference between newly designed money with the large heads and other security features in them. The rumor, as they usually always are, was based in fact. When currency circulates outside of its place of origin, counterfeiting is easier to get away with. In Liberia, from time to time, I noticed bills that, if they\u0026rsquo;d been given to me as change in the USA, would have made me call the manager. But as long as the staff accepts them, it\u0026rsquo;s not my problem. Why do they accept suspicious money from me? Because they have no fear that the guy selling cement bags at the corner will refuse it. That guy in turn doesn\u0026rsquo;t know or care about counterfeit US dollars, and so the bill moves on through the system.\nBanks who do international business don\u0026rsquo;t feel the same way about counterfeiting. Afterall, if a Liberian bank sends some counterfeit currency to London or New York, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to get passed on. It\u0026rsquo;s going to get subtracted from their total deposit amount. It won\u0026rsquo;t be investigated as a crime if it\u0026rsquo;s just one bill here or there, because it\u0026rsquo;s a drop in the ocean and the trail to the original counterfeiter has already gone cold \u0026ndash; it was likely introduced by North Koreans into Kenya by way of India and made it\u0026rsquo;s way across to Liberia overland. There\u0026rsquo;s a certain cost of accepting money from areas with endemic counterfeiting. It\u0026rsquo;s perhaps 0.1%, but it\u0026rsquo;s there. That\u0026rsquo;s $1 per $1000, and it adds up.\nBanks don\u0026rsquo;t just eat costs like that, they pass them on. One place that cost has showed up is in the exchange rate between USD and other currencies. The exchange rate between USD and Euros is different depending on the bill. Little heads low rate, big heads full rate. I don\u0026rsquo;t know who actually takes the fall for the fake bills \u0026ndash; who\u0026rsquo;s account is debited when they are removed from circulation. But whoever loses that money is not bothered, because they\u0026rsquo;ve already covered the cost (and more) on the spread between their \u0026ldquo;little head exchange rate\u0026rdquo; and what the true exchange rate should have been that day.\nOK, so back to Liberia. When the Liberian banks started charging a differential exchange rate (the same as their partner banks were doing in London), that reality-based fact morphed in the street into \u0026ldquo;the banks don\u0026rsquo;t take little heads\u0026rdquo;. The US Embassy put out a press release to try to stop the rumor. It said, \u0026ldquo;Dollars are dollars, big head or little. Every dollar anywhere on the planet can be exchanged for any other, and they are all dollars.\u0026rdquo; Which would be true, except it\u0026rsquo;s not. If you try to bring $10,000 from Liberia and spend them in the US, the odds that you have a counterfeit bill in there someplace are high enough that you\u0026rsquo;ve probably brought (on average) $9994 instead of the $10000 you thought you did.\nIn any case, a press release from the embassy certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough to stop this story. Whether because they believed the rumor, or because they just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be the only one not believing it (the musical chairs effect), within a few days the vendors stopped accepting little head notes. This was a few days before payday, and several staff brought the story to me, worried I would pay them in little head notes that they could not spend in the local market. I showed them the newspaper, and told them a dollar is a dollar. They told me, \u0026ldquo;a dollar I can\u0026rsquo;t spend isn\u0026rsquo;t a dollar\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to repeat that, because it\u0026rsquo;s part of the answer to the question, \u0026ldquo;what is money?\u0026rdquo;\nA dollar I can\u0026rsquo;t spend isn\u0026rsquo;t a dollar.\nSo, what to do? I called my boss in Monrovia, who\u0026rsquo;d had the same complaints. She made a quick decision: starting that moment, little head dollars no longer existed in the MSF system in Liberia. I was to find every little head dollar I had (a few hours work, in the end it was about 50 notes totaling about $550) and send them to her. She would send me back big head ones (thereby balancing our books). She\u0026rsquo;d send all of the little head dollars from the entire mission back to Geneva, and we\u0026rsquo;d change them there into francs and put them back into the budget at headquarters. Presumably she only chose non-suspicious bills to send back to Geneva, lest \u0026ldquo;MSF counterfeits dollars\u0026rdquo; were to show up in the newspapers the next day!\nProblem solved. The staff loved me because I paid them in big head dollars. And I learned, first hand, a little bit more about what is money.\nPS: Think rumors are funny? Managing rumors and knowing when to give up and get out of the way is serious business for humanitarian aid workers. Here\u0026rsquo;s an article about 3 Red Cross workers killed due to a rumor. My boss didn\u0026rsquo;t make the decision she made because she\u0026rsquo;s a nice lady. She decided this wasn\u0026rsquo;t a rumor that we were going to kill, and we needed to get the heck out of the way of it.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/03/31/my-favorite-things-all-at-once/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYay for \u003ca href=\"http://www.caida.org/~kc/\"\u003eold friends\u003c/a\u003e, economics, and technology!

Sometimes it helps to make a model, and useful models make predictions that stick. Climate change researchers haven\u0026rsquo;t been very successful at that, not because they are not smart enough or hard working enough, but because the climate is a really big complicated thing. Their models cannot explain past weather, and do not agree on future weather. Given that we cannot do large scale experiments on our climate, the best we have is the models. They don\u0026rsquo;t work. Politics and popularism that sways funding degrades science, because scientists will naturally seek the easy money, and will not go out of their way to make their own life difficult by spitting in the face of the rich research sponsors. Even if some climate researchers know that they are caught up in a hysteria and that the evidence does not support the hysteria, some of them will take the easy way out: take the money and give the answer the model says (and just keep their worries about the reliability of the model to themselves \u0026ndash; due to the next point). When people cannot rationally discuss multiple theories about a natural phenomenon because those theories that contradict the status quo are perceived as \u0026ldquo;corrupt\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dangerous\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;crackpot\u0026rdquo;, then science stops working right. This is happening now. Those who wish to investigate all possibilities are branded (most benignly) as \u0026ldquo;climate change deniers\u0026rdquo;, and usually much, much worse things. Read the rude comments sent Dyson\u0026rsquo;s way and be ashamed. This is one of our greatest living scientists. We should treat our elders with more respect than that. The climate might be changing in ways that are dangerous for humans or it might not. Humans might have changed it or not. That gives us four possible \u0026ldquo;realities\u0026rdquo;. 3 out of 4 of them do not justify any radical action on our part. The fourth possibility (man is making significant changes and the climate is getting dangerous to us) is, due to feedback effects, likely too far along for us to stop. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to live with the legacy we gave ourselves. But we\u0026rsquo;re smart enough and still rich enough \u0026ndash; but only if we get to work. There are many excellent reasons to get off the fossil fuel addiction including: global security, local ecological reasons (well drilling is icky), and economic sustainability arguments. Human-generated climate change is not one of them. Human development in resource-poor regions is fundamentally just, and any action we take regarding climate change must allow those countries to develop as fast as they possibly can. Nothing reduces sickness, early death, and sadness more than poverty reduction. Nothing. My MSF work is a great big waste of time (and a very small waste of money, comparatively). I know it, and most other MSFers know it too. There is money, big money, to be made on green technologies. There are great reasons to go out and try to make that money. Climate change is just not one of them. So, there you are, future socieology PhDs. When you find this blog post, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the hysteria was not complete and utter. There were people who were willing to point to the angry mob and call it what it is.\nPS: I found it cute that Dyson\u0026rsquo;s wife disagrees with him.

It occurs to me that one thing that\u0026rsquo;s missing, and not just a little bit missing, but radically missing, from the current system is negative feedback.\nWouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be interesting if we could set things up so that before the next bubble starts, the participants in the market can see that as certain stages of the bubble kick in, as measured by certain predetermined checkpoints, then certain economic brakes will be applied. We\u0026rsquo;d have to be careful not to take away all the control the Fed has, but perhaps you can invent a new set of levers which fall into this category of automatically triggered negative feedback.\nSome examples:\nIncreasing the reserve requirement Decreasing tax benefits of mortgage interest Increasing the fees FDIC charges a bank to insure its deposits Federal \u0026ldquo;encouragement\u0026rdquo; to states to make a rainy-day fund The idea is to take \u0026ldquo;bad ideas\u0026rdquo;, the things Republicans hate, that they criticize as \u0026ldquo;friction on the economy\u0026rdquo; and program them into the financial landscape before they are needed. You\u0026rsquo;d probably have to choose many more of them, to make sure they provided negative feedback in all segments of the markets. After all, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of only having a brake on the front right tire?\nThe triggers would have to be automatically scaled with respect to the natural growth of the economy. Because whether or not there is a bubble, economies grow. And you\u0026rsquo;d have to find some way to defend them against political meddling. It\u0026rsquo;s comparatively easy to defend the Fed against pressure as it twiddles its one variable (the Fed funds rate), but it would be something else entirely to work out some kind of system that protected all the other keepers of the negative feedback rules.\nOne of the negative feedback mechanisms I named above might not be too clear without a description. For better or worse, we have a federal government. That means the states have freedoms that (for example) English counties don\u0026rsquo;t have. The central government has no right to tell California that it should spend or save it\u0026rsquo;s money in a certain way. The \u0026ldquo;solution\u0026rdquo; has been to setup matching funding mechanisms, then make the federal funds contingent on the state following the advice of the feds. To encourage the states to build up a rainy day fund during economic booms, perhaps all of the matching rules could be parameterized with respect to some sort of \u0026ldquo;bubble index\u0026rdquo;. Matching would be 1 for 1 (100%) minus X, where X is calculated with respect to the current \u0026ldquo;hotness\u0026rdquo; of the bubble, and how much the state is lagging the federal target for rainy day funds. Smart states would control expenditure to create a big surplus to go into the rainy-day fund, thereby preventing their X from getting above 0, and them losing matching funds.\nWith all economic things, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to try (hard as it is) to play the chess game forward a few moves and try to figure out the consequence. The theory of net present value helps decisionmakers take into consideration the future. By warning decisionmakers today that certain economic brakes will kick in tomorrow, they should be more willing to consider options today they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have considered otherwise. On the other hand, even if there was certainty that the negative feedback rules were \u0026ldquo;out there\u0026rdquo; waiting to trigger, there would still be uncertainty on when the triggers would be reached. And it\u0026rsquo;s likely that some new and doubly-unstable form of speculation would come into existence.\nThough the Planet Money folks have already declared a moratorium on it, I have to say, \u0026ldquo;the devil would be in the details\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/03/28/negative-feedback/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePlanet Money is talking about the new Systemic Regulator, and also talking about other theoretical ways of regulating the banks.

They are professionals with conflicting responsibilities. Like all professionals, they do what they have to do to get the job done. Sometimes it is appropriate to filter something in order to maintain the breathing room for the network to do the job. In the early 90\u0026rsquo;s, filtering technologies certainly existed that could have killed off the web, but there was a critical mass of academic networks, and under-critical-mass of commercial ISPs. The academics were interested in seeing what new things were coming. The commercial ISPs were split between common carriers like UUnet, and walled gardens. As I already mentioned, the walled gardens had their own content technologies and wanted to move past the limitations of Gopher.

She was Icelandic, and she was really in distress \u0026ndash; able to understand how serious the situation was, unable to understand it at the same time, scared for the future, and reaching out to a friend. It was really touching. I replied to the guy that it was a shame I couldn\u0026rsquo;t access any of the Icelandic news as an English speaker, and that perhaps his friend would like to start a blog translating it, so that I could understand her country\u0026rsquo;s situation better. I offered to donate some money for the service.\nIt took off. NewsFrettir has consistent readership, and has been helpful to the girl, if not from by making a dramatic amount of money, at least as an emotional outlet and support. It always helps to know someone\u0026rsquo;s listening, that someone cares what\u0026rsquo;s happening to you.\nI come back from time to time and check it out, to see how it\u0026rsquo;s going for the girl I \u0026ldquo;met\u0026rdquo; anonymously last October. She\u0026rsquo;s strong. She\u0026rsquo;s weak. She\u0026rsquo;s above all, human. She\u0026rsquo;s struggling, but what makes her struggle all the more is her empathy for those struggling around her. I think about her and hope for the best. I donate some more money from time to time, but it\u0026rsquo;s not so easy for me either \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m on a student\u0026rsquo;s budget as well, because I\u0026rsquo;m living alongside my student girlfriend in a country where I don\u0026rsquo;t have the right to work. (I\u0026rsquo;m not complaining, this is exactly what I want from life, and what I chose. But I\u0026rsquo;m unemployed, and I have the budget to match.)\nNow, there\u0026rsquo;s another piece of the puzzle. Vanity Fair has published an article on Iceland. It gives me another view, and while it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change what I\u0026rsquo;ve already learned about one woman there, and how she feels about the changes in her community, it also shows me some other sides to the story.\nAnd on a relatively unrelated aside\u0026hellip;\nOne really great quote from the story is:\nYou can tell a lot about a country by how much better they treat themselves than foreigners at the point of entry. Let it be known that Icelanders make no distinction at all. Over the control booth they\u0026rsquo;ve hung a charming sign that reads simply, all citizens, and what they mean by that is not \u0026ldquo;All Icelandic Citizens\u0026quot; but \u0026ldquo;All Citizens of Anywhere.\u0026ldquo;\nThis observation is so, so, so true. The borders of the USA and the UK always make me scared, depressed, and annoyed. And I\u0026rsquo;m a middle-class white guy, with the right passport. I have the right to pass these borders and they still make me cringe.

The install process for Moonlight is no more braindead than all the other plugins I\u0026rsquo;ve played with.

A reasonable first impression would be, \u0026ldquo;good god, those people are sure stupid\u0026rdquo;. But I had another idea\u0026hellip; isn\u0026rsquo;t it interesting that a lot of people prefer pattern-based passwords, i.e. pressing the buttons in a certain order, without respect to the semantic meaning of the password. That means they are thinking visually, storing their password as a picture of the keys, and a mental model of the shape and direction their fingers will go to enter the code.\nSo why not take advatage of that? Here\u0026rsquo;s how it would work: anyplace there is a \u0026ldquo;enter password\u0026rdquo; box, the UI would say, \u0026ldquo;or, if you prefer remembering shapes, click here and we\u0026rsquo;ll generate a shape for you\u0026rdquo;. When you click on it, the password generator chooses a password based on a markov chain of key adjacency.

You show the user a little diagram of their new \u0026ldquo;password\u0026rdquo; to help them see the shape in it and program it into their memory.\nThere are some gotchas, of course. First, you have to give the user a chance to practice the password a few times, perhaps best done with some kind of highly visual Flash app (think Guitar Hero \u0026ndash; Password Hero!). Second, the key-adjacency info is keyboard specific, as anyone who has ever left the United States will tell you (hello? French people? You really like AZERTY? Are you crazy?)\nI have no intention of actually doing anything like this. I have a system for picking my passwords, and it works for me. Frankly, I don\u0026rsquo;t care about people too stupid to understand entropy and pick good passwords. This is why they don\u0026rsquo;t let me do UI: Left to my own devices, I\u0026rsquo;d just give everyone a PDP-11 console and let the UI itself weed out the idiots. :)\nBut, patent trolls: beware. This is prior art. I thought of shape passwords first, don\u0026rsquo;t bother patenting them suckers. I\u0026rsquo;ll open a can of patent-busting whoopass on you.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/02/08/bad-passwords-problem-or-opportunity/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.darkreading.com/blog/archives/2009/02/phpbb_password.html\"\u003eThis article\u003c/a\u003e includes some interesting analysis of passwords found in the wild.

Marina was brain-fried from a long day at school, and she said, \u0026ldquo;I wish I could just sit in front of the TV and zone out to TSI1 (Italian Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s public TV station)\u0026rdquo;. I said, let me see what I can find\u0026hellip;\nI searched on the net, and struck out pretty thouroughly finding a live stream for TSI1, but I did find some British TV on Zattoo. My laptop was booted in Linux at the time, so as I was grumbling about rebooting, I noticed they have a Linux player. So then I grumbled about how nothing ever works right in Linux while it downloaded and installed. It told me it wanted some more codecs, so I grumbled about how the state of video encoding is so complicated that nothing ever works without 1000 plugins while they automatically downloaded and installed with no intervention from me (save the grumbling).\nThen it just worked.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to repeat that, since I don\u0026rsquo;t even believe it myself: We watched 1 hour of straming video on Linux (via wifi, no less) and it just worked. Even the commercials came through just fine. Thank you Zattoo!\nMarina asked, \u0026ldquo;Why are there so many commercials? It\u0026rsquo;s not like this on Swiss TV.\u0026rdquo; And that made me start thinking about public TV, private TV, and TV licenses. When the threatening TV license renewal form came in the mail and accused me of commiting a serious crime (punishable but a GBP 1000 fine, no less) because I\u0026rsquo;d failed to renew my TV license, I just threw it away. The only BBC that Marina and I ever consume is BBC Leeds by FM radio, and a page or two on the Intarweb from time to time. I fail to see how I could possibly need a TV license for that.\nBut then I got paranoid. We were watching a TV stream that shall remain nameless, lest I incriminate myself. But I went and searched to find out if all those commercials Marina was complaining about meant that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need a TV license to watch this stream. And the answer that came back was completely nonsensical and useless. Go ahead, you go try and figure out the rules for watching streams in England.\nWhat it boils down to is this\u0026hellip; a TV license is required if you are watching a live stream (i.e. you cannot choose what\u0026rsquo;s on it when it starts). If you watch only video on demand, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a TV license. But the place I found that was on the BBC\u0026rsquo;s website. And it is not clear at all if that applies only to BBC content or to all British media. I used to think the TV license was simply a fee-based tax supporting the BBC. But it\u0026rsquo;s not. Because private broadcasters in England are subsidised using a part of the TV licensing revenue. Which means that probably the rules BBC clarified on their website apply to the commercial infested dreck we watched the other night. We won\u0026rsquo;t be doing that anymore\u0026hellip; the commercials sucked, and I can\u0026rsquo;t afford the GBP 150 TV license, let alone the GBP 1000 fine.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that, once again, I am on the forefront of lifestyle change caused by technology. I have not willingly* owned a land line since 2001. Now I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a TV since 2005. But the BBC\u0026rsquo;s website hilariously indicates that you don\u0026rsquo;t really need to worry about the specifics of licensing for online video since your home TV license (which you undoubtedly have) covers it anyway. When you walk through our poor neighborhood (poorest in Leeds!) and see a satellite dish on every single house, you realize that it really is true that everyone (else) must have a TV license.\nBread and circuses, indeed. All it takes to keep British subjects, er, subjugated, is an endless supply of chips and satellite TV 24x7.\n\\* I have a phone line right now because England\u0026rsquo;s broadband market is so fucked up you cannot get cable Internet without having a BT land line. Let me repeat that: you cannot buy cable Internet unless your cable company pays the telephone monopoly for the right to not use their network. And of course, the cable company passes the fee right on to you. When I think about it, it makes me so pissed off, I want to leave the phone off hook (thereby consuming a port on the switch) just to spite BT. But then I would need to make a special curcuit to defeat the dialtone timeout they use to protect their switch from people like me.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/02/05/the-confusing-state-of-streaming-video-in-england/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSomething really amazing happened to me the other night.

Functional Programming is part of the solution to the multi-core problem, which is the most pressing problem facing computer science to ensure continued growth in computer capabilities.

My work with Entuura argues, \u0026ldquo;no, smaller embedded devices will deliver more social good\u0026rdquo;. But better to plant mango stones in all types of soil anyway.\nSo I started looking into what it would take write a Scheme interpreter in assembly and ran across An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction [ PDF]. Which is something else entirely, a guided tour into the world of compilers, where you write a compiler for Scheme in Scheme, resulting in native x86 code that evaluates Scheme expressions. Since I never actually did a compiler class, this was even better. It would scratch my itch to get back into functional programming, as well as taking me on a guided dip into the waters of assembly, but letting me program my assembly in Scheme, which I prefer anyway.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve completed chapters 1 and 2 of the tutorial.

Perhaps it was my weak French, but it seemed awfully complex to me \u0026ndash; certainly not \u0026ldquo;1st floor, Thursday\u0026rdquo;, 2nd floor Wednesday\u0026quot;. So then she took me into the laundry room and showed me the electrical meter I was supposed to read before and after my laundry, and the logbook I was supposed to write the readings into. I asked, \u0026ldquo;because we have to pay for the electricity?\u0026rdquo; She said, \u0026ldquo;no, just to know\u0026rdquo;. In our friend\u0026rsquo;s apartment, there was a recurring \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; with handmade signs on the mailboxes. A note popped up next to them: \u0026ldquo;Dear tenants, We would like to remind you that it is strictly prohibited to affix notes on your own box. Please address yourself to the building superintendent, who has the proper materials should you desire to put a note on your box.\u0026rdquo; The notes in question were \u0026ldquo;Pas de publicitÃ©, svp\u0026rdquo;, which is the Swiss solution to Direct Mail. Since every post box in the country has that note, the direct marketers print 20% what they once did, then they recycle 100% of what they do print (as it is returned by the post office because all the boxes have the little notes). Problem solved. At another friend\u0026rsquo;s apartment, there\u0026rsquo;s another colorful and excessively complicated diagram showing which of the three flats cleans the stairway and entrance hallway on which week. There\u0026rsquo;s a little note at the bottom that suggests that Saturday morning would be the best time to do it. There are a lot of people who hate Switzerland after a few weeks (due to the pervasive, quiet, constructive but a little creepy pressure to conform). It always makes me happy when I contemplate those people and know that I\u0026rsquo;m not one of them, and that no matter where Marina and I travel, Switzerland will always be home.\n---\u0026ndash;\nUn article sur BoingBoing m\u0026rsquo;a rappelÃ© quelque chose que j\u0026rsquo;ai voulu dire au sujet de la Suisse. Bien que des fois je la dÃ©crire comme quelque type de paradis, avec des femmes suisses qui veulent vous Ã©pouser, les vaches qui donnent du lait chocolat, et chaque homme avec sa fusil de assaut\u0026hellip; mais c\u0026rsquo;est pas la vÃ©ritÃ© entier.\nLes propriÃ©taires suisses sont fous. Et les suisses, qui ont un certain zÃ¨le pour l\u0026rsquo;harmonie sociale, leur cÃ¨dent. Voici, certains des exemples:\nChez mon second appartement Ã Lausanne, la propriÃ©taire m\u0026rsquo;a montrÃ© un tableau colorÃ© et m\u0026rsquo;a expliquÃ© (en dÃ©tail) pendant quels matins ou aprÃ¨s-midis des quels jours des quels semaines nous avons eu accÃ¨s Ã la laverie. Peut Ãªtre il Ã©tait au cause de ma franÃ§ais faible, mais cela me semblait terriblement complexe \u0026ndash; certainement pas si simple que \u0026ldquo;premier Ã©tage: jeudi\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;second Ã©tage: mercredi\u0026rdquo;. Puis, elle m\u0026rsquo;a montrÃ© le compteur Ã©lectrique ou je devait relever le chiffre avant et aprÃ¨s de faire la lessive, et le registre ou je devait Ã©crire les mesure. J\u0026rsquo;ai demander, \u0026ldquo;parce que nous devons payer pour l\u0026rsquo;Ã©lectricitÃ©?\u0026rdquo; Elle m\u0026rsquo;a dit, \u0026ldquo;Non, c\u0026rsquo;est juste pour savoir\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Chez une amie, il y avait \u0026ldquo;une problÃ¨me\u0026rdquo; rÃ©currente avec des affiches fait Ã main sur les boites Ã postes. Un annonce est apparue Ã cotÃ© d\u0026rsquo;eux: Â« Cher locataires: Nous vous voulons rappeler que c\u0026rsquo;est strictement interdit de attacher des affiches sur votre boites Ã lettres vous-mÃªme. S\u0026rsquo;il vous plaÃ®t, vous adressez chez le superviseur du bÃ¢timent oÃ¹ vous trouverez des matÃ©riaux convenables. Â» Ces affiches disaient Â« Pas de publicitÃ©, svp. Â», la solution suisse pour Ã©viter le publicitÃ© par poste. Parce que presque chaque boite Ã lettres dans le pays a cette affiche, les publicitaires impriment 20% de ce qu\u0026rsquo;ils faisaient jadis. Puis ils recyclent 100% de ce que ils impriment â€“ tous sont retournÃ©s par la poste parce que toutes les boites ont les affiches. ProblÃ¨me rÃ©solu! Chez un autre ami, il y a un autre tableau aux couleurs vives et excessivement compliquÃ© qui explique quel des trois appartements doit nettoyer les escaliers et le foyer chaque semaine. Il y a un petit note au fond qui suggÃ¨re que les matins des samedis seront les meilleures temps de la faire. Il y a pas mal de gens qui dÃ©testent la Suisse aprÃ¨s quelques semaines lÃ -bas (au cause de le omniprÃ©sente, tranquille, constructive, mais lÃ©gÃ¨rement sinistre pression de conformer). Chaque fois que je pense Ã eux, Ã§a me fait sourire parce que je sais que je ne suis pas une des ces personnes.

I realized at least part of it comes down to the freedom that comes from a durable social contract\u0026hellip; a sense of solidarity and interdependence springing from deep down in the Swiss culture.\nSo imagine my happy surprise when my buddy Curtis pointed me at this blog posting: one to look after the other. In England, we have neither freedom of speech, nor the right to carry guns. This makes it diametrically opposed to the theoretical United States. In the United States, we have pretty good freedom of speech and we are continually losing our right to carry firearms. The author of the post I linked says:\nFew politicians trust their citizens unconditionally with either ( the right to free speech or the right to carry firearms). The more they allow the free use of one, the more they clamp down on the free use of the other, depending on political denomination. Almost no politician is comfortable with a citizen having unrestricted rights to both.\nAnd it occurred to me, after thinking about Switzerland on the bus this morning, that Switzerland is a place with freedom of speech and the right to carry firearms. In fact, the Swiss have a power even stronger and more dangerous right than free speech: the right to direct democracy. And almost every Swiss man has an assault weapon in his house.\nAll of this is theoretical of course. I do not personally believe in the \u0026ldquo;armed society is a polite society\u0026rdquo;*, nor in the \u0026ldquo;guns/words dichotomy\u0026rdquo;. None of this musing really has a thing to do with my personal thoughts on the issue, which are my normal muddled mÃ©lange of socialist, capitalist, libertarian and utopian/progressive tendencies. My personal thoughts on guns are something along the lines of, \u0026ldquo;Well, there\u0026rsquo;s no real problem with guns, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want them in my life, and I don\u0026rsquo;t mind other people having them, except that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice if we were building a society where they didn\u0026rsquo;t want them?\u0026rdquo;\nPerhaps you can see why virtually everyone who discusses politics with me eventually gets frustrated and gives up\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t really fit into boxes very well.\n\\* The first image that comes to mind when I think of \u0026ldquo;an armed society is a polite society\u0026rdquo; is a sunny morning in Chad, hunkered in a safe room, hoping that stray (or even targeted) gunfire didn\u0026rsquo;t kill any of my colleagues.

Of course, any reader of mine know my biases: I am a cynical humanist capitalist from Silicon Valley (engaged to be married to a practical humanist socialist from Switzerland), who chose to work with MSF due to it\u0026rsquo;s independence. Because this article speaks to the core of my identity, of course my biases are going to be the key to my understanding of it.\nFirst, above all, it is remarkably candid about the reality of our work. There\u0026rsquo;s a funny-if-it-weren\u0026rsquo;t-so-sad explanation of how UNHCR field people are reduced to writing reports about reports, and how in N\u0026rsquo;Djamena, they are compiled into reports about reports about reports and sent to Geneva. He found someone candid enough to tell him the MMM theory of relief workers. He hinted at, but unfortunately did not discuss at length, the fact that many (most?) international UN humanitarian workers are African expats who are doing it for the money as much as for love of the work. There is fertile ground (full of landmines) to be explored there: What does it do to the UN\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness that many of it\u0026rsquo;s field people don\u0026rsquo;t like their job but are trapped in it by economic forces? How can international workers be effective when their primary motivation is not solidarity with the beneficiaries, but with their family (and it\u0026rsquo;s bank account) back home? What\u0026rsquo;s the solution?\nNext, I say the article is too hopeless. At least one reason it is hopeless is that the situation in Darfur and along the Chadian border with Sudan is so hopeless. It\u0026rsquo;s a political/economic situation, a proxy war between the West and China. It puts into opposition China\u0026rsquo;s need for resources and disinterest in international norms with the international humanitarian principles the west stands for. No big surprise what wins out: as usual, follow the money.\nThe other reason it is hopeless is because the journalist got the UN side of the story. The MSF side of the same story has its roots in our very reason to exist, the MSF charter. MSF is in Chad the same reason we are in any country: because patients need us. MSF has hundreds of stories to tell about people in Chad (refugees, citizens, rebels, soldiers, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter who) who needed help and MSF had the capacity in place to give that help, when and where it was needed. There\u0026rsquo;s something beautiful in that, and the journalist let the heat, the walled compounds, the driving sand, and the rebel attacks divert his attention from the beauty and the power of what it means to just be there, and to be human, alongside other humans. He came close: he personally experienced the pain we all feel when you can\u0026rsquo;t do enough for one, let alone for everyone. That\u0026rsquo;s human, and that\u0026rsquo;s the hard part of the job.\nHe missed reporting on the the humanitarian imperative, which is too bad. Did he miss it because his hosts at UNHCR and WFP also are missing it? Or was it there, and he just blew it as a journalist? I suspect the answer lies somewhere in the middle, and I don\u0026rsquo;t blame him one bit.\nWhich brings me to my final critique, which is that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover the story from outside the UN bubble enough. But there\u0026rsquo;s enough other brilliant journalism about MSF and other actor\u0026rsquo;s work, so perhaps it is valuable just to have the UN story.\nGo, read. This article has won a place in my bibliography of humanitarian aid stuff.\nPS: The headline is \u0026ldquo;Lives of the Saints: International hardship duty in Chad\u0026rdquo;. Headlines are often picked by editors long from the story, and I hope this one was. The people the author talked to undoubtedly told him that aid workers hate to be called heros, saints, or anything other than simply their job title (e.g. log, nurse, protection officer). Our work is too important and too dangerous for us to tolerate show-off heros as colleagues for very long. The professionals in the highest leagues of humanitarian aid (and he met some of them) know they are neither saints, nor heros and they never allow someone to call them one.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2009/01/09/the-new-yorker-on-aid-work/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere is a really excellent \u003ca href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/05/090105fa_fact_harr?printable=true\"\u003earticle on aid work\u003c/a\u003e in The New Yorker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough this is pretty much a write-only blog at this point, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really know if anyone cares, here are my reactions to the article:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is remarkably candid, but\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit is too hopeless\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebecause it focuses too much on the UN and not enough on independent actors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, any reader of mine know my biases: I am a cynical humanist capitalist from Silicon Valley (engaged to be married to a practical humanist socialist from Switzerland), who chose to work with MSF due to it\u0026rsquo;s independence.

According to David, the time when we stopped being able to save data was in the 50\u0026rsquo;s because xerography (which is the same as laser-printer technology) came into existence then. All other data archival techniques (magnetic storage on tape or disk, recordable CD\u0026rsquo;s, etc) are inferior to toner pressed onto paper, which is itself inferior to ink soaked into paper fibers. And, come to think of it, ink on paper is inferior to marks on clay tablets \u0026ndash; though ink on paper has proven to be stable enough, since we use knowledge today gleaned from papyrus scrolls from thousands of years ago.\nSo this thread popped up on Slashdot, and made me think about it again.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go back to marks on clay for a second. Why are they the best data archival we know of? Because they are information storage in a physical arrangement of a chemically stable material. The key to data longevity is to recognize these two things, I think:\nData is stored by arranging some physical quantity in a measurable way The longevity of the data is related to the stability of the physical quantity A few observations:\nThe cost of data storage is related to the economics of the physical quantity used to represent the data, and the logistics of moving it past a reader. Magnetic spots on spinning platters = cheap; holes in paper = expensive. The digital era has been dominated by people reducing the cost (and a related dimension, size) of the physical quantity being manipulated to store data, by trading off longevity of the data itself. So taking all that into consideration, it seems to me to way to solve the data longevity problem is to put the necessary research into reducing the costs and storage density on a stable medium.\nAnd where do you find funding for research like that? Three places come to mind: fundamental research done by universities with government funding, and foundation funding for work that relates to their vision, and venture capital to productize something that\u0026rsquo;s theoretically possible, but not yet a proven business.\nPeople interested in this kind of thinking would also be interested in the Long Now Foundation. And I wonder if the Long Now Foundation would be interested in finding a cost-reduced, stable data store?\nAs for the vulture capitalists\u0026hellip; what kind of business could be made from this opportunity? What if I made and operated the equipment to make archival an medium that took the form of \u0026ldquo;data artifacts\u0026rdquo;? I think I should I operate it as a manufacturing plant, taking data in and returning to the user the artifact with the data stored on/in it in a stable form. That lets me amortize the cost of my equipment across lots of data artifacts, which is good for the end-user as well. With the factory approach, there would be a fundamental question of data security, which would be easy to manage with open source (and thus transparent) encryption techniques. But the nice thing about the factory is that it would leave the safe storage of the artifacts in the hands of the customer. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be on the hook for storing their data, and they don\u0026rsquo;t want to be paying rent to me to do it. Though there are lots of companies that currently pay rent to Iron Mountain to store physical artifacts of questionable value (hard disks are about the last place you should put data you want to ever see again *).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how the software side of it would work. I\u0026rsquo;m doing it first, because I\u0026rsquo;m a software guy, and an amateur encryption guy. Also, the software side is easy! You feed it a corpus of data to be stored, and it gives you several options and the current prices for implementing each of them. One option is RAID: it uses a N-of-M coding system, and offers to spit out M files, each of which need to be sent to be manufactured into an artifact. Then you need to store the M artifacts, and make sure that at least N of them survive and can be gathered into one place to be read. Another option the piece of software can offer the user is encryption, so that the artifact manufacturer cannot see the data. In fact, to protect the manufacturer from liability, I think I\u0026rsquo;d recommend that the software refuses to make output without encrypting it.\nBut encryption opens up the can of worms of how to keep the key next to the data forever. I propose epoxy. (No, I\u0026rsquo;m not kidding. KISS.)\nAnd to protect the data owner and the manufacturer even more, there would be an independent foundation, operating with seed funding from the data archiving company, which manufactures and sells key artifacts at cost. That way, the key and the data are not sent to the same factory at the same time. They have a license to the patent covering the artifact creation equipment, but their license permits them to make artifacts only up to 100 kilobytes in capacity, which is enough to save the key and the meta-data on how to use the key, so that any mathematician 1000 years from now will be able to re-implement the stream cipher that the key material initializes.\nSo what are these artifacts? Well, that will be the object of the research, won\u0026rsquo;t it? The research program will come down to exploring this problem space for the sweet spot.\nmaterial longevity and cost density of recording marks on the given material and the cost of recording them reliability of reading equipment and the cost of reading the data I suspect the right choice for cheap long term material will be some kind of ceramic (polymers are too chemically unstable and precious metals are, well, too precious). And I suspect the cheapest way to arrange that physical material into data will be to use a laser to burn spots onto it. Thus the reader will be a digital microscope with simple edge detection and decoding software.\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m not making this up: I\u0026rsquo;m proposing to replace ink on paper with marks on clay.\nFunny how the world turns, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n\\* From Data Storage Technology Assessment â€“ 2002 Projections through 2010:\nHigh density HDD\u0026rsquo;s suffer more signal loss because the magnetic grain volumes are smaller. At high areal densities, the energy barrier between the thermal energy and the magnetic anisotropy of each magnetic particle is not high. Industry-established design criteria call for recorded data output loss of 1 dB or less per decade, or 2 dB loss over 20 years. A 2 dB data output loss is normally related to a bit error rate (BER) increase of X10 or less, which is well within the capability of the error correction system built into all data storage devices.\nDecibels (dB) are a logarithmic measurement: the difference between 1dB of attenuation and 10dB of attenuation is exponential. The loss a mag tape or hard drive will undergo during 10\u0026rsquo;s of decades will result in a loss of any hope of recovering the data from within the background noise, error correction or no.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2008/12/13/long-term-data-storage/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about data archival the other day because \u003ca href=\"http://www.sahtp.com/\"\u003eDavid Hagan\u003c/a\u003e was telling me about one time when he spoke to a group of librarians and told them to expect a data gap starting in 1950 and extending until we get serious about data preservation.

Is 45 days too long to take it?\nFirst, taking it 45 days is no big deal. It\u0026rsquo;s taking it for months on end (9, 18, 60) that is not recommended \u0026ndash; not because of actual risks, but because of not enough study.\nSecond, here\u0026rsquo;s Jeff\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;cut-through-the-crap\u0026rdquo; guide to malaria meds:\nDoxycycline: It\u0026rsquo;s an antibiotic which means you can get the side effects of long-term antibiotic exposure \u0026ndash; development of resistance in the bugs, GI problems, and for women, yeast infections. On the other hand, those aren\u0026rsquo;t common, are easy to recognize, and switching off the doxy is easy. And the side-effects of low-level exposure to anti-biotics are also useful: you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry so much about eating street food! For fair-skinned people, the most dangerous side effect is light sensitivity, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a common problem. Lariam: This has a bad reputation because of side effects. 9 in 10 have no side effects. Of the 1 in 10 who have side effects, 9 in 10 overcome them in a couple weeks. The reason it has a bad reputation is that the side effects are psychological, not physical. So people get wigged out about it a lot more. If it works for you, it really works, and it\u0026rsquo;s better than the others. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and the process of finding that out is a little bit scary (sleep problems, depression, even risk of suicidal thoughts). But when you do the math, you see it\u0026rsquo;s 99% likely you\u0026rsquo;ll be in the first group. Taking it only once a week is a little hard to remember, but it less hassle than every day. Malarone: It is expensive. It has less drawbacks than the others. Consider it the last choice \u0026ndash; because it is guaranteed to work out nicely, but the others have useful features you should consider before giving up and accepting the drawbacks of malarone. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken all three. Right now, I use Lariam.\nThird, no matter which you decide: TAKE IT. Malaria in white people ranges from a small case, which makes you completely useless for 1 to 2 weeks, to a major case which makes you completely dead for the rest of your life. It is easy to get confused, because malaria often presents itself in native Africans like the flu \u0026ndash; a little under the weather, but they can still go to work. So you get confused and can\u0026rsquo;t remember why you are supposed to be taking your medicine for this thing that is only a minor inconvenience for your colleagues.\nAnd to drive home point #3, two anecdotes:\nA USAID official who worked in Ghana told me that every year in West Africa, Peace Corps has two or three volunteers die from malaria. Why? Because the kind of people attracted to Peace Corps are young, invincible hippies who are too cool to take their medication (and don\u0026rsquo;t believe in it anyway), and too cool to ask for help when they feel sick. So they get malaria, get complications, are too far from medical help, and die. I once met an MSFer who told me he told his coworkers he was feeling a bit bad and left the dinner table early to get to bed. He woke up, 3 weeks later, in Paris, recovering from cerebral malaria. His colleagues found him comatose in the morning and arranged for his evacuation. But to calm you back down now that I scared you, let me make this final point\u0026hellip; when treated, malaria is not deadly to healthy people (neither to Africans, nor to whites). The complications from malaria (anemia, cerebral swelling, liver failure) are deadly, but they are not guaranteed, nor do they set in immediately. If you are pregnant or living with HIV/AIDS, then complications can rise much quicker. If you have a fever in malaria endemic areas, you must start Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as soon as possible. Don\u0026rsquo;t wait for a test, and do not wait to get to high class medical treatment. Find anyplace that has ACT and start yourself, even if they disagree and won\u0026rsquo;t start you. If you don\u0026rsquo;t respond in 24 hours, start the trip to find the best treatment you can (and keep taking the ACT during the trip).\nPS: Best quote ever from a guy who did deadpan humor well: \u0026ldquo;Wow, I\u0026rsquo;m really having trouble sleeping\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know why\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve been taking my Lariam every night before bed, and for some reason the side effects just aren\u0026rsquo;t going away!\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2008/12/13/malaria-medicine-advice/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA friend sent me this question:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of healthy, when you\u0026rsquo;re in Africa, do you take malaria medication the whole time you\u0026rsquo;re there?

I was on a contract with the Health Metrics Network, which is a project running under the auspices of the World Health Organization, but funded by the Gates Foundation. HMN is supposed to go around building a network, not of routers and switches, but people who understand the challenges of constructing and running health information systems. Those people should be researchers, technologists, and public health people. And those people should be a mix of those talking about it (easy to find in Geneva, they are douze pour une centime) and those doing it. The latter are a little harder to find\u0026hellip;\nWhich brings us back to the headline, and what I was doing in Sierra Leone. Our colleagues in Sierra Leone were stuck. They have the will to be doers, but the project wasn\u0026rsquo;t moving. I went to give it a kick in the rear, and man did I. I had a great time, and I enjoyed getting to know my colleagues. It remains to be seen if we\u0026rsquo;ve unstuck the project and gotten it going. But for sure we\u0026rsquo;ve delivered something that has the potential to be transformative and to unlock people\u0026rsquo;s curiosity and creativity.\nWhat I did was remarkably like what I did after Hurricane Katrina. I arrived in a hot and humid place, quite unfamiliar to me, and go to work. I dug through the boxes of stuff that my colleagues had ordered. I figured out what people there knew, what they wanted, what they were capable of, and what they needed. As usual, it is the consultant\u0026rsquo;s job to listen to people tell you what they want, then make them feel good about it when you give them something different. After the first day\u0026rsquo;s work (\u0026ldquo;the rapid assessment\u0026rdquo; in consultant-speak) we got to work.\nWe hired an electrician to install a big honkin UPS they had. I supervised that work, saying a quick prayer of thanks that MSF\u0026rsquo;s log school had given me a good lecture on three phase power. Our electrician did pretty good work, though he was a little unclear on the concept of ground. Once I remembered my British English (which I learned from RedR), and pointed out the \u0026ldquo;earth wire\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;d cut off and neglected to connect to anything, then he got with the program and we fixed things right up with a few quick patches.\nI installed a little network, then went to do some network archeology and found an old network that had been forgotten and turned off. We got it back in service, then hooked it up to our little network extending all the way to the Minister of Health\u0026rsquo;s office. When the new zippy VSAT link is installed and stable in a few weeks, my colleagues will schedule a meeting with him to show him his snappy new access to the Internet and to the national health information system, and he\u0026rsquo;ll be blown away!\nAt least, that\u0026rsquo;s the plan. But why was I there? What sense can it possibly make to send a white dude from Leeds thousands of miles for only two weeks to run around yelling and throwing dollars at problems? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be better to have local people do it?\nIn fact it would, and what it takes is a project manager with vision, able to engage and manage a local IT firm. I went to see if we had those pieces, as much as I went to kick the project in the butt with a concentrated bit of white-dude energy. What I found is some of the pieces. I found a local firm named Tiwai Memory Masters founded by two guys from the returned diaspora after the civil war. They know their stuff, and they\u0026rsquo;ve trained their young employees right. The boss of Tiwai wasn\u0026rsquo;t afraid to give me a little ribbing either: \u0026ldquo;My partner is going to complain about how you did that ground wire, but don\u0026rsquo;t pay any attention to him, he\u0026rsquo;s just picky.\u0026rdquo;\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t bother pointing out that the ground wire was the electrician\u0026rsquo;s fault, not mine. I just took my lumps and smiled. I was smiling because I\u0026rsquo;d just seen the future of Sierra Leone: a smart techie, with a sense a humor, and pride in workmanship.\nI came back and gave a presentation to the Talkers in Geneva. I told them: There are Doers in Sierra Leone, get them under contract and watch this thing fly!\nBefore I forget, if you want to see some pictures of African doers doing, take a look at these two links:\nBaobob Health Partnership The Repairmen of Nigeria God I love those guys\u0026hellip; they can make anything work. All they need is a reason to believe in themselves, and in their project. The Nigerians get paid their reason to believe every day \u0026ndash; they hack hardware for profit. How can we get that energy redirected to work that makes lives better?

She decided to \u0026ldquo;invest\u0026rdquo; in Mohammed by giving him a gift of 100,000 leones (in today\u0026rsquo;s currency, about USD 30). With that, he bought movies and started walking around after school selling them.\nAfter Steve and I had talked to him a while, I asked him for the \u0026ldquo;financials\u0026rdquo; of his business. It should be noted, at the beginning of our conversation, he was reluctant to talk about his business, I suspect out of fear that we were investigating piracy. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works out\u0026hellip; the DVDs are available one at a time from a wholesaler for SLL 8000 per disc. He sells them for SLL 10000, for a profit of SLL 2000 per disc. Mohammed keeps a stock of around 50 discs right now (\u0026ldquo;51\u0026rdquo;, he proudly told me!). His inventory has gone as high as 81 discs. He started his business years ago with 25 discs, bought using the initial capital from his Indian benefactress.\nPerhaps there is a discount for buying in bulk, but Mohammed didn\u0026rsquo;t mention it. I suspect he rarely has the capital to replenish his stock. Instead, Mohammed\u0026rsquo;s business model is just like any extremely small business: he constantly balances how much money he can take out of his business to pay for school fees with how much he needs to reinvest disc by disc to replenish his stocks. I found it interesting as well that he remembered his exact highest inventory with pride \u0026ndash; for Mohammed, his inventory is his life\u0026rsquo;s savings. Can you imagine the risk and the burden of carrying your life\u0026rsquo;s savings on your back? What if they are stolen? What if the price of DVD\u0026rsquo;s collapses?\nSteve bought a DVD, \u0026ldquo;Harrison Ford Mega Pack\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s SLL 2000 more profit for Mohammed, but not enough to pay this week\u0026rsquo;s school fees. Here\u0026rsquo;s hoping he sells some more discs today\u0026hellip;\nAs an aside, Mohammed told us that you can buy DVD\u0026rsquo;s mastered and manufactured in Nigeria for only SLL 6000. Theoretically, you can sell them for SLL 10000, just like the ones that Mohammed sells, which come from China. But Mohammed says that the Nigerian discs are lower quality and though they offer double the profit, if you sell them to a customer and it does not play right, then you lose a customer. He prefers to sell the lower profit and higher quality merchandise from China.\nSteve and I were thinking about it a bit, and it\u0026rsquo;s true: when you buy these DVD\u0026rsquo;s on the street, in the marketplace, or in a restaurant, it\u0026rsquo;s just a throw of the dice if it will work. On our travels, we\u0026rsquo;ve both bought DVD\u0026rsquo;s that didn\u0026rsquo;t play right. There are certain brands of pirated DVDs that look good, and in practice prove to be good. One brand that looks particularly good is \u0026ldquo;UPS\u0026rdquo;. The pirates just took the UPS logo and slapped it on their discs, and it works! It looks professional, and it turns out the pirates professional enough to pirate a logo as well as the content, make good discs! Mohammed is right; customers prefer the Chinese discs.\nThis is field economics at it\u0026rsquo;s best.

Is it seasonal? If so, in which cultures yes and which cultures no? Why?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important because if you expect 52 complex births a year and each mother needs 7 days in a bed, do you need one bed in your hospital or three? At that scale, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter so much, but add a zero or two onto the end of the figures, and the question of \u0026ldquo;10 or 30 beds\u0026rdquo; makes a great deal of difference to budget, logistics, HR, etc.\nSo you can imagine how I chuckled when this came into my mailbox:\nHAITI. The team is struggling to respond to needs of women giving birth these days, as it is the yearly peak resulting from Carnaval festivities in February. For example, yesterday 158 women were in labor at Jude-Anne hospital (60 bed hospital). This means that women were giving birth in every available corner of the hospital property, from the rooftop and stairwells, to the triage space outside. The family caregivers could not enter the hospital due to lack of space and frenetic activity. Also local health structures in Port-au-Prince are still not fully functional, as they are either without proper medical equipment or on strike. This means that MSF is the only hospital functioning in the city for women giving birth. It also means that MSF cannot refer patients to these structures.\n(This is from an internal report that I am not normally allowed to forward. But seeing as this information is not security sensitive, I feel comfortable bending the rule this one time.)\nAt first glance, the idea of carnavale making so many babies they have to be born on the roof sounds a little funny\u0026hellip; you imagine a yearly baby boom and who doesn\u0026rsquo;t smile at the thought of a hundred cute newborn babies?\nBut to understand why this situation is sad and dangerous for Haitian mothers, you need to understand this: Worldwide, the vast majority of births are not done in a hospital. They are done at home, or perhaps in a health post. Only complex pregnancies (perhaps 10%) need to be seen in a hospital setting. The maternity ward in a resource poor context is only occasionally a scene of joy with beautiful new babies popping out of healthy mothers. More often, it is a scene of fear, uncertainty, pain, and loss. Women who end up in the hospital as a result of a pregnancy have drawn the short straw and are at risk of losing their baby, their future fertility, or even their own life.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;ve rained on your parade too much, go visit The White Ribbon Alliance and watch one of their movies.

Thanks.)\nWhy doesn\u0026rsquo;t a website already exist where I can pay a tip into a tip jar?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard and annoying to rent movies. I went to my corner store, and got a grilling about residency \u0026ndash; which is incredibly difficult to prove as a visitor in the UK. Then the DVD didn\u0026rsquo;t play right on my laptop because I reinstalled Windows XP without the special install disk from IBM, so I lost the right to play DVDs on my own machine (but this same machine runs VLC to decode Xvid movies just fine). Then I forgot to return the DVD that didn\u0026rsquo;t play right on time, so I got a fine for a DVD I never could see!\nI resolved then and there to never rent a DVD again, as long as I live. I\u0026rsquo;ll just go back to what I used to (hypothetically) do, which was download pirated movies. I\u0026rsquo;d like to pay for them, but I can\u0026rsquo;t. Why can\u0026rsquo;t I? I just don\u0026rsquo;t understand why I can\u0026rsquo;t pay somone. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of people in my life I don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay, who I have to pay (hello Yorkshire Water Company, are you listening!?!). Why can\u0026rsquo;t I pay the studio when I get their content via a distribution channel they don\u0026rsquo;t even have to pay for ?\nIn my dream world, here\u0026rsquo;s how it works:\nSomeone sets up a website called OldBatteredHat.com. There\u0026rsquo;s a form on the front page, that says, \u0026ldquo;your paypal name? how much? URL of the content? tip!\u0026rdquo;. The URLs have to be from a small list of sources the site operator wants to trust as catalogs of copyrighted content. I\u0026rsquo;d make it IMDB for movies, FreeDB for music, and Registered Commons for Creative Commons stuff. You click on \u0026ldquo;pay by paypal\u0026rdquo;. If your paypal account is not linked to a bank account, it says, \u0026ldquo;warning, you\u0026rsquo;re stupid and will be paying some of your tip to Visa instead of to the artist. Continue?\u0026rdquo; Then the payment goes through. You get a receipt with a \u0026ldquo;tip transaction number\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of scary leagalese that says that you are making a gift to the website operator, and that they don\u0026rsquo;t have any responsibility if the money never gets to the right place, but that they will try to check claimants well, but no promises.\nThe website operator has a nightly job harvesting all the tip money and rolling it into a paypal money market account. It also posts a full accounting, publicly, of the transactions for the day, week, month. It updates the \u0026ldquo;top grossing\u0026rdquo; web page, or whatever other fascinating stats he wants to post. Because he\u0026rsquo;d be committed to running the site with maximum transparency in order to earn and maintain trust, anyone could calculate the stats that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother to list.\nThere is a UI for content owners to come collect their tips. They have to submit a PDF\u0026rsquo;d scan of their declaration binding their copyright ownership to their paypal name. The website admin reads the PDF and decides if it\u0026rsquo;s valid for the given work and if so, posts it in the system with an expiration date. The content owner is able to collect tips as often as they want into their paypal account (they will discover that they have to link it, or else they pay huge fees to get paypal to send them a check). Like everything else about the system, this is radically transparent: the PDF declaration is linked with the outbound transactions, so that tippers can see who\u0026rsquo;s coming to pick up the money they left.\nAs the site gets more popular the load of reviewing the declarations and investigating if they are real or fake will be unbearable for the operator, and he\u0026rsquo;ll put in place a crowd-sourcing model, where people vote up correct declarations an vote down false ones. The operator then needs only check the top declarations to see if he\u0026rsquo;s willing to put his credibility on the line by approving them for making withdrawals.\nThe operator of the website does this out of the goodness of his heart, though he also takes tips if they come for him. He also earns interest on the tips waiting to be collected by the copyright owner. Finally, he has the right to collect tips that have been waiting for a content owner to show up for too long \u0026ndash; and because of his radical transparency, everyone can see which tips are about to get claimed by the operator. Tippers cannot be refunded (didn\u0026rsquo;t you read the scary disclaimer, moron?). But if they are really up in arms about their tip being claimed by the operator, they should just contact the copyright holder and make sure the copyright owner comes and collected the tip. That\u0026rsquo;s their only recourse, and it\u0026rsquo;s good enough.\nWhoever does this first will eventually get sued. He\u0026rsquo;ll post a notice saying he is afraid he\u0026rsquo;ll lose his house, it will all be very dramatic, and people will contribute to his legal defense, etc, etc, etc. These stories all follow the same stupid story arc. In the end, he will in fact lose his house, and he\u0026rsquo;ll be bitter and not try again, but someone else will. They too will get sued, and after a few more cycles, there will be one or two trusted tip-jar websites that stay up and don\u0026rsquo;t get sued. And the world will be a better place.\nIf you take this idea and are one of the guys who get sued and loses his house, sorry. But don\u0026rsquo;t say I didn\u0026rsquo;t warn you. If you take this idea and it takes off, please just send me a bottle of scotch.

Perhaps it is because my work with MSF always takes me to shitholes (*).

It\u0026rsquo;s just true that everywhere in the world there are shitheads and they are intent on pulling down that which society is struggling to put up around them.

User J controls his own domain name. For sake of example, call it \u0026ldquo;nella.org\u0026rdquo;. He wants to be his own authentication provider, and take back total, final control of his name online \u0026ndash; he is tired of being jeff.allen here, jeff.r.allen there and jra99 in a third place. He just wants to be nella.org/jra forever, or at least for as long as he can afford to pay for the domain name. He\u0026rsquo;s also lazy, so he uses delegation, and at least that seems to work right (but read on).\nHe starts looking for places to use his shiny new OpenID. He can use it on his blog, because it is Wordpress, and Wordpress is an OpenID consumer. He can use it at SourceForge. Nifty. But that\u0026rsquo;s where it ends. He tries to use it to log in to Yahoo, but because Yahoo is an OpenID provider, he can\u0026rsquo;t associate his OpenID with his Yahoo account. He continues searching and continues finding the same thing \u0026ndash; he\u0026rsquo;s already got 10 OpenIDs he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want, and can\u0026rsquo;t use the OpenID he does want!\nImran made the observation that the \u0026ldquo;before you generate, accept\u0026rdquo; rule is like the GPL: recursive in order to focus effort on building instead of competing. It occurs to me as I write this that it\u0026rsquo;s also like the Robustness Principle (which I prefer to remeber as Postel\u0026rsquo;s Law in order to commemorate a great man): Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from others.\nBlogger is a special case. First, Blogger authentication is the Google Account, so if Google was an OpenID consumer, then Blogger would be too. But they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Except they are, kind of, because one of the options in Blogger when leaving a comment is to login with OpenID. Which according to lots of people, works. For nella.org/jra it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and it seems to have something to do with delegation, because with my undelegated OpenID, it works. Memo to Blogger: stop adding buggy features to your site and hop the train down to Mountain View to visit the GooglePlex to help the Google Accounts team become OpenID consumers. That would fix your problem better and fix all the other Google properties as well.\nWhich brings me to my second proposed best practice: Test delegation, in every conceivable configuration!\nDelegation is super-major-cool-magic, and if your site can\u0026rsquo;t do it right, then you are not doing OpenID right and pissing off the power users who should be complementing you.\nPS: This is a common complaint, so hopefully OpenID consumers are listening and will get off their ass and implement the actually useful side of the protocol. It\u0026rsquo;s not so hard\u0026hellip; take Wordpress as an example. When a new OpenID arrives, it creates an anonymous account, ties the OpenID to it, and lets the user login. Later, if they care enough, they finish setting up their account.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2008/10/11/better-practices-in-openid/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYahoo published \u003ca href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/openid/bestpractices.html\"\u003esome best practices\u003c/a\u003e on OpenID, but I have one they forgot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imran.typepad.com/\"\u003eImran\u003c/a\u003e and I were talking at \u003ca href=\"http://imran.typepad.com/blog/opencoffee/\"\u003eOpenCoffee Leeds\u003c/a\u003e the other day and we independently and together came up with this realization:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOpenID providers should be required to be OpenID consumers first.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?

As with everything this century, it\u0026rsquo;s moved onto the Internet. But the essential tone of the conversation, and the impossibility of resolving the problem remains.\nFor me the solution is radical. We need to cut the profligate aid budgets and instead put concentrated effort on what\u0026rsquo;s important: respect for human rights, economic growth, and individual expression and inventiveness. Give a healthy person a chance at education and a stable economy into which to pour his inventiveness and effort, then reward him with results. We know this works. How? Because it\u0026rsquo;s what happened to Switzerland in the 1800\u0026rsquo;s, to Brazil in the 70\u0026rsquo;s, and to Malasyia in the 80\u0026rsquo;s.\nMSF should keep working to put out burning fires \u0026ndash; no one is interested in economic growth when there is a cholera epidemic. MSF should cut it\u0026rsquo;s fundraising and budget down to the point it can only afford do emergency work. (MSF has a lot of make-work projects, where they are looking for and finding an excuse to work in order to burn up the cascade of cash falling on them.)\nUSAID and DFID should suffer budget cuts of 99%, and should use the remaining 1% to teach good governance. Food aid should be phased out, the WFP should be shut and the core of its expertise should be moved into HCR, another agency that, regrettably, has to keep existing to put out fires.\nPlaces like the Gates Foundation should invest in fundamental advances in healthcare, but should stay out of the field. Their sole work in the field should be along the lines of Mo Ibrahim, who\u0026rsquo;s foundation rewards good government. Africans need to live in a context of several generations of good government before they will have the confidence to stretch out their entrepreneurial muscles and reach for their dreams.\nI am not saying that nothing any of these agencies do is of any value. What I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that until Africans are living in a world where they are held responsible for their future, and supported on the path, the problem won\u0026rsquo;t be solved. (And the problem holding us back from universal justice on this planet is Africa, not Asia\u0026hellip; watch the videos at Gapminder to be convinced.)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve said it before and I\u0026rsquo;ll say it again just so no one misunderstands me: Africans are smart enough and hardworking enough to change their continent for the better. Our job, as residents of continents that developed a few 10s or even 150 years earlier is to stand by and support them when they ask for help.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2008/10/09/same-conversation-different-venue/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe dirty secret of aid work\u0026hellip; it always comes down to this\u0026hellip; the navel-gazing, \u0026ldquo;why am I here\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;why is it so ineffective\u0026rdquo; conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually it happens around the campfire, over a bottle of locally made beer, or perhaps for the lucky coordination team in the capital city, at the nearby expat-only restaurant over a nice bottle of South African wine.

I switched because I am too old, too lazy, and too impatient to do Linux sysadmin anymore. I outsource it now. Especially mail system setup, which has become an infinite nightmare as a result of spam. With just a few clicks at their really excellent control panel, DreamHost let me outsource all the hassles of email to Google, while still keeping control of my web server. And actually DreamHost helps me with that too, because with a few more clicks on the control panel, I installed WordPress in my blog, then upgraded it a few months later.\nI changed from MT to WordPress because the MT world has become too corporate and confusing. Is it open source or not? Is it about communication, or about selling licenses? I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable with it. Also, I\u0026rsquo;d installed WordPress at Tellme, and customized it to do some clever stuff with single signon authentication (obligatory for corporate intranet blogging). I really loved the design, it felt clean, fast, and calm. MT, on the other hand, always felt like a lumbering beast of a CGI \u0026ndash; the kind of thing I used to write and hate myself for doing. (I\u0026rsquo;ve just noticed another good reason to use WordPress: auto-saved drafts, like in Gmail. That single feature makes all the Web 2.0 buzz tolerable.)\nIn a former life (WebTV and Microsoft) I was on a project to integrate Passport signon to something, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what. I remember loving the idea of third-party single signon, and hating Passport\u0026rsquo;s implementation. I kept watching as Liberty Alliance made the same mistakes, just to make them in an alliance against Microsoft. You guys remember that? When it used to be \u0026ldquo;everyone against Microsoft\u0026rdquo;, and you\u0026rsquo;d have these strange alliances like \u0026ldquo;IBM + Sun + Oracle + Windex + Cargill Salt\u0026rdquo; trying to knock down Microsoft. It was all rather pathetic and disgusting. I just wanted single signon to work.\nSo I disappeared from tech for 4 years, and when I came back, OpenID was finally done and working right. Cool. And it REALLY works right. Delegation is the coolest thing ever, and makes it so so so easy to get an OpenID that you control and will always control your whole life regardless of what becomes of Microsoft or Liberty Alliance or Windex. So the first change I made to my WordPress install was hack it to allow only OpenID. If you want to comment on my blog, you have to have an OpenID. Starting here, starting now, the \u0026ldquo;password per site\u0026rdquo; madness ends.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I recommend to do it:\n1. Signup at GetOpenID 2. (optional) Edit a webpage that you own to include the delegation magic. View source on http://nella.org/jra to see the magic. Look in the tag. 3. There is no step 3. If you did only step 1, GetOpenId tells you what your new ID is, which will be a URL starting with getopenid.com, and ending with your name.\nIf you did step 2, the URL of the page you edited is your OpenID. Choose which page you put the delegation magic in carefully, the whole world will know you by it\u0026rsquo;s URL.\n(There is another way to get an OpenID, where you control it 100%, and don\u0026rsquo;t have to trust the nice people at GetOpenID at all. I will let the aluminum hat brigade carry on with that, and get on with my life in peace, thank you very much.)\nLogin to my blog with your OpenID, and WordPress automagically creates an account for you. You can edit your profile if you want, or just leave it. The defaults are good enough.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2008/09/26/some-tech-stuff-dreamhost-wordpress-and-openid/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSince I am getting back to tech life, a good first post would be about tech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat caused the big downtime was a not-very-careful switch from a friend\u0026rsquo;s Linux server to DreamHost.

Her name is Marina, and we\u0026rsquo;ve been together over a year now. She and I weren\u0026rsquo;t ready to talk so publicly about our relationship until now, but now the time has come, so that\u0026rsquo;s the first really great piece of news for the blog in 2008.\nI met Marina in Liberia (and astute readers of my blog from back then will find some references to her). She was a coworker, and we were living in a small compound with 7 other MSFers, so we started off with a great deal of discretion. We have some funny stories about how each of our coworkers found out about our little \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo;. The important part is that the boss, who liked to play the part of the mother to us all, didn\u0026rsquo;t find out until the very end\u0026hellip; that means we \u0026ldquo;won\u0026rdquo; the game. :)\nWhen we both got back from Liberia, we really had to adjust. Was it just something that happened to us inside of the MSF bubble, or would our relationship work in real life too? It took all year, and some hard times, to find the answer to that question. But the answer now is clear: YES! We are together now in Switzerland, and planning how to stay together.\nAnd that leads me to the second piece of news: we have found a posting with MSF where we can live and work together. We will be in AdrÃ©, Chad for 6 months. I leave January 10th, and she follows 2 weeks afterwards. I have been studying French during the last 5 months here in Switzerland to give me a reason to stay close to Marina and develop our relationship. Furthermore, I chose to study French to help my career with MSF and to help us have more possibilities to be together \u0026ndash; now that both of us are bilingual (at least for some types of jobs) that makes many more possibilities where we can live and work together, all around the world. After Chad, who knows\u0026hellip; but perhaps we will live in Geneva while Marina studies, and after that we can continue working around the world.\nI will be working as a logistician in AdrÃ©, where MSF operates a hospital. It was a government hospital before the hostilities in western Sudan boiled over the border and destabilized the eastern frontier region of Chad. Now, there are 240,000 refugees from Sudan in the area, and demand for services like healthcare, water, and feeding have overwhelmed the Government of Chad\u0026rsquo;s ability (and willingness) to provide. Thus, eastern Chad has become the humanitarian aid industry\u0026rsquo;s second front in the war in Darfour (the western state of Sudan).\nMy work will concentrate on construction and water systems, because MSF has the goal to rehabilitate a series of health posts and put them back into service during 2008. But in fact because the situation there is so volatile, I might end up working on other things instead\u0026hellip; like the evacuation plan. :(\nMarina will be a nurse in the hospital. She will be responsible for the normal things an MSF nurse does in a post like that. She will be responsible for the pharmacy, the sterilization, the management of the nurses and the nurse aides, for ongoing training to improve the standard of care. This is actually quite a boring post, like her first one with MSF several years ago in Laos. To her credit, she\u0026rsquo;s decided to take it to come with me to Chad. I suppose I will owe her big time when she finds something interesting to do somewhere else in the world and I have to find a way to come along with her!\nThe context where we will be working, eastern Chad, is really much more the traditional MSF posting than Liberia was. Compared to Chad, Liberia is a vacation paradise. We will have a tough time sometimes, but we\u0026rsquo;ll be together and that seems to give us more courage. That\u0026rsquo;s how it should be with your partner, but it\u0026rsquo;s perhaps not such a good idea to give each other courage when you are talking about a war zone! But, we\u0026rsquo;ll be back inside the MSF bubble, where there are enough security rules, enough resources to keep us safe, and a healthy aversion to taking stupid risks. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a big adventure, and hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll really learn a lot from it.\nFinally, some administrative details\u0026hellip; I am going to purge my huge list of people and only send updates from Chad to those who really want them. If you have gotten this far in my message, you clearly are interested. So please reply to me via e-mail and I will keep you on the list. If you have not read this far, don\u0026rsquo;t send me e-mail. :)\nI will not be posting messages from AdrÃƒÂ© on the website publicly until after I get back next July. If you want to keep up with me, it has to be by e-mail. If you are reading this on the web, you need to send me e-mail to get on the list.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2008/02/03/very-happy-new-year-news/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello everybody, and happy new years. 2008 is going to be really great for me, I have some news to share here to get all those who are interested in my travels back up to date with my life and my plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/jeff.allen/Marina/photo#5038569798669660322\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://lh5.google.com/jeff.allen/ReyYiVG3cKI/AAAAAAAAAEc/-hwBDymULFI/s144/DSC07083.JPG\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e First, the most important thing in my whole life\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve finally found the perfect girl for me.

Then I moved to Lausanne, Switzerland where I studied French for two months for 4.5 hours a day. I also enjoyed riding my bike a lot, up to 200 km a week, through the Swiss countryside. I moved to Geneva and stayed with friends there during September and some of October. I volunteered at MSF Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s headquarters, doing special projects for the Logistics department there and continuing my French with a private tutor.\nI went to Geneva to work with the logistics department because I was frustrated that MSF\u0026rsquo;s recruiters have not yet found me a posting. The problem is that over this year, I have always found something interesting to do that takes me back out of the pool of available volunteers. So instead of continuing the pattern that was not working, I decided to make a commitment to living in French-speaking countries, studying, until MSF is ready to interrupt my studies and send me to the field.\nIn fact, what happened was that the Geneva Logistics department had an extra spot in a training course and sent me to that instead! So for the last week I have been in Brussels Belgium with colleagues from all of the operational sections around the world studying together in the Technical Logistics Course (TLC). This is a very big deal for me; this course is required to do all the things I want to do in my MSF career (work as a logistical coordinator, work on the emergency team, start a project). Also, to do this training, I had to agree to work for MSF for 12 months more. This is no problem for me, but it should motivate them to give me a posting and get their money\u0026rsquo;s worth!\nI am currently working with my recruiters to find a posting where I can work in French. Because I can\u0026rsquo;t understand French too well when it is fast, or on a radio, or in a meeting, this is tricky. The key is to choose a mission without security problems, or where the security information could be safely handled in English. To ask someone to slow down and repeat something about a truck full of food is one thing. But to miss an urgent warning and drive into a checkpoint of unhappy soldiers is quite another.\nThe class so far is quite good. We have class each day from 9 am until 9pm with coffee, lunch and dinner breaks.\nAlso, my birthday was a few days ago. One of the most important lessons I learned in the TLC is \u0026ldquo;Never have a birthday when you are surrounded by 30 logs, one of whom is from South Africa.\u0026rdquo; MSF Logs are legendary among MSF people for always being able to supply the alcohol, no matter the challenges, and it was no different here in Belgium. I ended up digging my own grave, because an Englishman who does not speak French asked me to translate for him. He was trying to get Sambucca, but the woman didn\u0026rsquo;t know about it (and I was already too drunk to translate Sambucca into Pastis \u0026ndash; the French anise liquor). After many tries, he got frustrated and said, \u0026ldquo;well, does she have tequilla?\u0026rdquo; I translated and she said, \u0026ldquo;mais oui, monseiur! Un tequilla?\u0026rdquo; Bon. But then my friend says to her, \u0026ldquo;Non, dix sil vous plait!\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;d been had. First, apparently my friend spoke enough French to get himself ten tequillas, after all. And I suppose you can guess that they were not all for him, but for me and the rest of the table. We did manage to get the teacher of the course to take a tequilla shot. no surprise there, actually\u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;s a log too, you see. I somehow ended up with two of the ten shots, and though I am old enough to know better, it is hard not to take a second tequilla shot when you\u0026rsquo;ve got 9 logs chanting \u0026ldquo;drink, drink, drink\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, a good evening was had by all. The morning, not so much\u0026hellip; but we all got up early and got on the bus.\nThe bus takes us to MSF Supply, the supply base for MSF Belgium. There is a log playground there where we can see stuff as it looks in the field, and generally walk around in the mud. Dirty logs are happy logs, so we are happy logs.\n(See the pictures here to see what dirty, happy logs look like.)\nNext week we have mechanics, more water and sanitation (i.e. more dirty logs), and something else I can\u0026rsquo;t remember right now. The class finishes on Friday and I return to Geneva, then on to Lausanne. I will join a French class there again, and continue studying. I am also hoping to do a programming project for a friend who works at the WHO, but that is up in the air, as usual.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2007/10/27/hello-from-belgium/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello again after a long time away from writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I wrote last, I took a nice trip around the west coast, then hung around California doing some IT work.

This is because smarter people than me have stuffed the tiny 8 meg flash images with useful tools, leaving no room for my bloated Perl-ware. So the question becomes, how can I live with what they gave me and still get what I want done.\nI wanted to do some secure file exchange stuff, and have it work over multiple protocols. So I was investigating OpenSSL. It turns out you can do everything you need to run a custom PKI with the commandline OpenSSL program and shell scripts. You need a way to marshal the various pieces together (the public key, the session key, the data itself, a hash, etc) and wrap them up, then unwrap them at the other end. The professionals use complicated systems based on BER and so on. Then they need to link against huge binaries to make it all work right. But I only had busybox available to me. Could I still make something useful?\nI started off thinking about tar, which can put a bundle of data together. But I really like the tight encoding in BitTorrent\u0026rsquo;s Bencode format, and sending around tarfiles seemed kind of hokey (but don\u0026rsquo;t laugh, that\u0026rsquo;s all .deb files are, and RPMs are just CPIO files). So I thought it would be nice to have Bencode/Bdecode available for me to use. But the only standalone tools I could find used interpreted languages, and adding Python to my little Linksys box was exactly what I was trying to avoid.\nI ended up, basically as a kind of sick joke, writing my own Bencode/Bdecode in shell script. Don\u0026rsquo;t laugh\u0026hellip; people were doing this in the 80\u0026rsquo;s with shar files, which had the added benefit that they could uncompress themselves!

Our security rules limited our movements to either a handful of pre-approved places inside the city, or pre-planned movements. The rest of the time we were in our compound (our curfew for all people and vehicles was sunset). We had twice-weekly car trips to the capital city, which was 6 hours by car away.\nMy day was not the crazy 20 hour day you live on a vaccination project. Instead, my day started at 7am with a normal breakfast. From then on, I chased technical details (security, food inventory, vehicle maintenance, construction management) and human resources problems until 5pm, with a solid hour and a half of quiet time around lunch. I worked 10-15 hours a week after hours on accounting work. I chose to work this way because of the workload, and because these tasks requiring concentration are best accomplished in the peace and quiet of the evening. Also counting thousands of US dollars with extra people around the office is discouraged by the security rules (and common sense).\nOnce a week or so we would have a movie night where the guy from Action Contre le Faim next door came over and shared their 80 gigs of DIVX movies with us. This was the maximum extent of inter-organization data sharing! I slept 8 hours a night, except 2 nights a week on average when I was awakened for an hour or so for some problem (generator, transport problem, freight arrival). I spent 4 hours a week helping MSF nurses with their data entry into (brain damaged) Excel worksheets. Having a better health metrics system, and trained users, would have reduced the stress of monthly reports on everyone.\nI had a GSM phone on the global network (in/out to USA and Europe as easy as: 00 country-code local-number). I had reliable e-mail connectivity via satellite with a bit rate of around 100 kbit/sec. I could not do HTTP nor HTTPS. I submitted my reports and did \u0026ldquo;offsite backups\u0026rdquo; by burning a CD and sending it on a car to Monrovia. We used Windows 2000 on Thinkpad laptops. We used Thunderbird for e-mail, Microsoft Office tools, VLC for playing movies. We had a projector, which we used for showing training films and presentations, and for movie night.\nI think I would have had some time and attention available (perhaps 3 hours a week) for IT-based mapping tools and some data entry, especially when it could generate instant gratification in our local area of operations. We did not have the resources to debug stuff, download patches, or write programs. I could not use Google Maps, let alone Google Earth. It would have been easy for me to receive GeoRSS-formatted e-mail attachments and see them rendered, but only if I had a local map drawing system.\nIf other field workers would like to give a short description of their work environment to set the stage for tool makers, I would be happy to host your comments here, or to link to them if you put them on your own website.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2007/08/14/a-look-at-field-life-for-tool-makers/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have recently been talking with some folks about IT tools for humanitarian aid workers.

What we found is that the technology needs were well in hand, either because the needs were not dire or because people had what they needed already. We met the operator of a small wireless ISP who educated us on where he buys equipment, how much locally purchased things like towers cost, and so on. It was a really excellent visit.\nWe also talked to the field coordinator for the MSF Beglium emergency team working in West Sumatra. She told us she was getting along just fine with her laptop, her cell phone, and a cable that let her access the Internet with GPRS. In fact that night at the airport we saw another young woman doing the same thing. There is also the much faster 3G over CDMA Internet service here. Getting info about the price was difficult and confusing, but it is clearly the right tool for disaster relief workers. If you have CDMA service in your area, then it is hard to beat it for ease of setup and take down. This is the same lesson that we learned in New Orleans, where Verizon\u0026rsquo;s 3G wireless service kept an Internet cafe online at the Common Ground Collective for many weeks.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s where we went in Sumatra: we hired a driver in Padang and went the long way to Bukit Tinggi via Solok. We witnessed quite a lot of destroyed buildings, but the earthquake response was in full gear and both the government and the International NGOs had what they needed to get the job done without us sticking our nose in the way. From Bukit Tinggi, we drove back down to Padang. In addition to being educational, the drive was extremely beautiful.\nNext we flew to Medan, which is a quite modern city with a western-style mall. It was interesting to see what things were available in the Ace Hardware store, and in the Acer and Nokia company stores. We moved on from Medan to Banda Aceh. After just a short 2 hour plane flight, I felt like I was in a different world, kind of like being back in Liberia. Aceh was under-served by government for 30 years during the struggle for independence, and it shows\u0026hellip; but only on the surface. The economy and the local government structures are all working fine. The other thing that is evident about Aceh is that the economy is still fueled by the NGOs. About 80% of the cars at the airport had NGO logos on them, and I even got to see one of my beloved HZJ78 Land Cruisers, which I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen since I left Liberia.\nOur hosts are International Medical Corps. They let us stay in their guest house in exchange for doing some IT work for them. We worked a few days, cleaning up computers and adding a DHCP server to the network. Their VSAT connection, at about 128 kbit/sec is fast enough to be comfortable. I proposed to speed it up some by adding a ClarkConnect server, but the site manager was unwilling to add something new to the network before he leaves in a few weeks. Fair enough.\nWe spent a nice weekend at Pulah Weh, where we got to see where the expats go for weekend breaks. The food was ok, and the snorkling was pretty good. The bathrooms were typical Indonesian ones, which don\u0026rsquo;t take much getting used to once you have mastered Moroccan toilets. There is a diving center there that looks very nice, and I am considering going back there for a bit of a vacation to take my PADI Open Water certification, if the work slows down. Though I think I will take a van instead of a motorcycle next time: I was chased by a really mean monkey, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to face him again from the back of a motorcycle!\nWe caught the regular IMC shuttle down the coast to Lamno. The site manager there had recently sent a request to his boss to have an IT guy come from Banda. Since Jon and I were in the neighborhood, it made sense for us to come on down.\nLamno is a village on the western coast of Aceh, about a 2 hour drive away from Banda. It has a relaxed atmosphere, and because the main street was set far back from the ocean, it survived the tsunami relatively untouched. Of course, like everywhere along the coast, many people died, but the infrastructure survived and that has made it a good base of operations for NGOs, which in turn is good for the local people.\nHere the VSAT is only 64 kbit/sec, and you can feel it. They were already using Windows Internet Connection Sharing, so we were able to simply replace that not-very-good NAT and DHCP server with a much better ClarkConnect server. The result is better NAT and DHCP, a transparent web proxy, and a file server which people can use to share documents. The web proxy was the biggest improvement. We can see in the logs that we are getting lots of hits to the cache, especially on the graphics used in Yahoo Mail, which is the primary mail provider for the staff. Every time something is served out of cache, it feels faster to the user and reduces the demand on the satellite link. The other thing we have done is convert most people to using Firefox with Adblock Plus, further reducing the bandwidth by stripping out many ads.\nWhile we were here, another NGO asked if they could put wifi gear up to share the Internet connection. I did a little feasibility study to make sure their equipment would be professionally installed and not conflict with what was already here, etc. I was pleased to recommend that they set up the link as soon as possible.\nWe have cleaned up lots of viruses and trojan horses, and confirmed that all the computers are using DHCP and getting the benefit of the ClarkConnect server. We will move on soon, perhaps along the coast to Calang, or back to Banda where we have a meeting with a potential client on Saturday.\nOne really pleasant thing about working in Indonesia is that people constantly drink dark, rich Acehense coffee (kopi aceh), and contantly offer it to you. So we enjoy a cup of coffee now and then during the day. This morning, Jon and I discovered a great breakfast place where you can have a donut or a little pastry with custard in it. The man brewing the coffee does a theatrical job of filtering it and pouring it into the cup. You really have to just come here and see it, I can\u0026rsquo;t describe it.\nThe weather here in Lamno is better than in Banda. There is a nearly constant breeze, and the temperature seems to be a bit lower breeze or none. The sunsets are great, and up above the orange horizon you can spot gigantic fruit bats with wingspans of at least 3 feet making their nightly trip from the caves at the ocean up to the mountains to feed. Being fruit bats, we can\u0026rsquo;t count on them to eat the mosquitos. But something must be eating them, because there are not many bugs here at all.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2007/03/28/debugging-our-way-around-sumatra/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI last wrote from Padang, where we were looking into the state of the technology and looking to see if NGOs responding to the earthquake there needed help with it.

We met the operator of a small wireless ISP who educated us on where he buys equipment, how much locally purchased things like towers cost, and so on.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a tiny update to give you a taste of things to come in the next few weeks.\nI got back from Morocco and settled into my home away from home in Switzerland. I met Marina, a former coworker from MSF who I met in Liberia. We traveled around Switzerland seeing old friends of hers. I practiced some Italian, went cross country skiing, and spent quite a while sick as a dog from a stupid cold I got in Ticino.\nI returned to the US and hit New York where I talked to MSF, then Seattle where I saw my nephew and his parents, then on to Portland, Roseburg, and San Francisco. It was great to see the family and friends on the west coast.\nI have had enough vacation, and I have been looking for my next job. I talked to the founder of Humanlink about working in Indonesia opening his first office there. The job would have been 3 months, and would have interrupted my MSF career temporarily, which would have been ok, but maybe not so good. The timing wasn\u0026rsquo;t good anyway because I wanted to be in San Francisco in late April to see Marina again when she comes through the US on a month long trip.\nA week ago or so there was a sizable earthquake in Padang, Indonesia on the island of Sumatra. Jon decided to change plans and do a 1 month exploratory mission, starting in Padang and seeing where Humanlink could be helpful. He invited me to come along for the trip, and since it fits into my plans perfectly, I decided to come along.\nSo on Wednesday night we left San Francisco and then we had a 30 hour long Thursday due to crossing the international date line. I went to sleep last night wondering if my watch would EVER change to Thursday! I woke up this morning refreshed, and now I am at the government\u0026rsquo;s office for coordinating relief work. The situation here is completely under control, because Indonesia is very practiced now, and because the earthquake was small and did not effect government in the big city. Tomorrow we will head out to the country where the damage is and meet with CARE, MSF, Medcins du Monde and others and get a feel for how they are doing, if we can help, and how we will be able to help next time once Humanlink has the base here up and running.\nWe will head on to Aceh, where there is much more development work going on. We will fly up there on Monday afternoon.\nI will post more info about what we are exploring, and finding, in the next few weeks. In the mean time, go to Humanlink\u0026rsquo;s website to see what Jon\u0026rsquo;s vision is.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2007/03/15/hello-pandang-indonesia/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo I have neglected to write an update for a very long time.

This is like standing up in an atheist convention and yelling, \u0026ldquo;Long Live the Pope!\u0026rdquo; Everyone knows that all civilized people believe in Global Warming, and the Grand Conspiracy to Prop Up Big Oil by Denying the Action of Greenhouse Gases. It gets even uglier because these days I mostly hang around Europeans, who have been brainwashed about the Global Warming story for much longer than Americans, and consider it one more indication that they are the more highly advanced lifeforms. (Regarding foreign policy and cheese, I will admit that Europeans are in fact more advanced lifeforms than Americans. The jury is still out on the state of the press, as I happened to read a few UK celebrity rags recently, and it appears that not even American journalism has yet fallen that low. But I digress.)\nThe thing about Global Warming is that it is incontrovertible. Over time our planet gets warmer and colder, and it is currently warming. This is not news. The question is, why is it happening? The answer that all civilized people have been taught by their media is that car exhaust is raising the temperatures. The problem with that answer is that it is politically touchy (useful to some, annoying to others). As a result, it polarizes debate and makes it impossible to continue discussing all the possibilities. And considering all the possibilities is how science actually works.\nI believe in science. Above all, I believe in it. Certainly above the media, and also above political discourse, which both have too many human failings. On the timescale of 20 to 50 years, science wins. Science has human failings too, but science gets the right answer eventually, while the politicians still have us scared and stampeding away from the wrong answer.\nGo read this article, or at least the headline: An experiment that hints we are wrong on climate change.\nSo, I will infuriate my European friends again when I say again: I don\u0026rsquo;t believe greenhouse gases cause global warming, and here\u0026rsquo;s the latest reason why. The sun\u0026rsquo;s and cosmos\u0026rsquo; interaction with our atmosphere can explain the cycles of all history, not just industrialized history. It can explain things that greenhouse gases can\u0026rsquo;t explain. This, or a theory more like this one than the politically guided greenhouse gas theory will end up being right. It will end up being right because when politics forces scientists to shine a light on a certain theory, you get more evidence for it, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get any more right. What makes a theory right is not thousands of scientist working on it because there\u0026rsquo;s no money for any other idea. What makes a theory right is it\u0026rsquo;s ability to explain things that the other theories can\u0026rsquo;t explain, no matter how popular or unpopular it is.\nOne of the things that makes my role in these discussions confusing to people is that I do agree that we need to achieve a reduction of carbon emissions. But I believe that because of the economic impact of peak oil, not because I think that carbon has anything to do with climate change. There are 1000 good reasons to stop using fossil fuels the way we are using them. Global warming just isn\u0026rsquo;t one of them.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2007/02/12/another-theory-of-climate-change/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have from time to time astonished, annoyed, or otherwise aggrieved my friends by denying that greenhouse gases cause climate change.

I signed up for a four day trip but it got extended to a five day trip because a storm came in and dumped snow in the pass.\nThe main thing I remember from the trip is how cold it was! The weather in Morocco is about like weather in California. It gets cold in the winter, cold enough that we all have heaters in our houses. This is the difference between rich pampered Americans and Moroccans. They know the cold only lasts through January and February so they just put on a coat and a blanket and get on with it. The problem is that there is literally nowhere that is heated, so you spend days and days never really getting warm. Like you come in out of the van with windows that don\u0026rsquo;t quite close and a heater that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work, and you go into the restaurant which is really just a terrace and a kitchen, then after you check in to your room where the tile construction makes it feel just like a meat locker. The hotels do not have hot water, or certainly not enough to take a shower. When I put water into the sink to wash and warm my hands the sink itself cooled the water down to less than lukewarm as it was filling!\nThe only relief is the hammam. I went to one in Ourzazate, but it was not quite as hot as I hoped and they were repairing some pipes. So they were banging on a huge pipe with a big pipe wrench. Hammams are built with vaulted ceilings, so it was like being inside a bell that was ringing. Not relaxing but at least it was warm.\nThe Berber communities we saw were really beautiful. The landscape is like Nevada and Arizona so the native buildings fit into the landscape in the same way the adobe in the southwest does. People are tiring of resurfacing the mud buildings every 3 years so they are moving out of the kashbahs and into concrete and tile buildings of typical Arab construction. This trend will cause these amazing communities to be lost to erosion and neglect. Perhaps the King of Morocco should work with Unesco to find a solution.\nWe rode on camels into the desert two nights in a row. Which was sort of strange scheduling, but whatever. We joked that the first night was camel training and that the second night we should show our camel licenses. Apparently \u0026ldquo;camel licenses\u0026rdquo; does not translate into Berber too well because the camel guys didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was nearly as funny as we did. The stars were absolutely incredible, totally unimaginably bright and clear. Totally worth the two mornings with a sore butt from camel riding.\nI traveled with a Latvian family and a Serbo-Croatian couple. It was a big surprise when I found out that the Serb is currently working in Monrovia for UNMIL Radio. I told him that it was very popular with the staff in Saclepea, especially the \u0026ldquo;drive time\u0026rdquo; show. It always struck me as funny that the drive time show was so popular, since most of the staff walked to work and the closest Saclepea had to traffic jams was when ducks lay in the road and refused to move until a passing woman threw some rocks at them for us.\nI am feeling a little sick with something that makes hadaches and sore joints. Instead of rushing off to the coast, I took it easy today. I went for a nice walk in the sun, then finally gave in to the pain and got some Tylenol (thank god I worked for MSF and learned the INN drug name for it, paracetemol). Then I watched Casino Royale in French. I was expecting a regular Bond movie where I could just figure it out by the chases and explosions. But it had a bunch of stupid talking in it so I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue what really happened! I will have to watch it again in Englih I guess.\nTomorrow I will take the bus to Agadir or maybe Essouira. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I am not very motivated to travel around right now. I guess I am just impatient to be back in Geneva. Morocco is just a little to reminescent of Liberia for me\u0026hellip; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel so much like an interesting place to travel as an uncomfortable place to make the best of until it is time to go home.\nThe other day to nice guy who works at the Internet cafe asked me how I liked Morocco. I went to some effort to explain how beautiful it is, and how clean, and how much I liked his Internet cafe before letting loose with what was really on my mind. I told him I was tired of being targeted by the touts trying to get my money and that I did not think it was a very respectful way to treat guests. I told him that I would recommend to my friends not to come here as a result, and that the only worse place I have ever been was Senegal (and that I tell people not to go there too). This really made him sad, as it is a point of pride in the Arab world to treat guests well. I was feeling a bit irritable at the time, but I\u0026rsquo;m still glad I said what I said. This is not a very fun place to visit, and if Morocco wants to expand tourism and attract different kinds of people, they have got to get the message out and make people stop hassling the tourists.\nThe problem is that the few who act poorly undermine trust, making it impossible to have a normal interaction with the multitudes of friendly helpful Moroccans. For instance the first two times I went in the souk I found myself lost and willing to get some help from the kids who say \u0026ldquo;This way to the big square.\u0026rdquo; But both times they steered me into a dead end and into their brother\u0026rsquo;s shop. After that, how am I supposed to trust kids offering to give me help? I ignored one today and chose wrong, ending up in a dead end. When I walked back by him he laughed at me. Not a very nice experience; not a very nice kid.\nSo now I stick to places I know, and avoid any tourist aspect of Morocco as much as possible. I have my favorite place to eat (it is Lebanese, not Moroccan alas), I am staying with a family that gives me good advice (and who sadly agrees with my complaint), and I am counting the days until my plane flight out of here.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2007/01/31/visiting-the-atlas-mountains-and-the-sahara/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI got back a few days ago from a big trip across southern Morocco.

Far from being a problem, that means I am doing things right.\nAfter traveling in Dakar, the touts, faux guides, and various other types of urchin are no problem for me. In fact, as they are incredibly effective at reading people, I get approched a lot less because they can see that they will have no power over me. Still, I get my share of them. I turned into an alley yesterday and immediately realized it was a mistake because this guy launched into a speech. I ignored him furiously, staring at my feet and pretending to be deaf. Out of desperation he started guessing nationalities: Vous etes francais? American? Spanish? Greek? England? Taiwanese?\nTaiwanese?!?\nHe got me. I cracked up because it was so insane. And as his reward I turned around and gave him a big handshake and admitted that I was in fact not deaf, and that I am American. He was my new best friend for another 10 meters, but by then he was too far from his store and he had to scamper back to start the cycle again with the next \u0026ldquo;Taiwanese\u0026rdquo; traveler.\nI got squeaky clean at a hammam last night. This is the same thing that is called a Turkish bath in other places in the world. It is really daunting when you don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue what the hell is going on. But it is really cool too and you get cleaner than possible in the dinky gross shower in the hotel. I went to the male version of a local hammam. Other options are female local ones and touristy ones which are more like western health spas. For 8 dirham you get access to the steam room and the cooler bathing rooms, and if you brought all the right stuff (soap and various kinds of washing glove things) you can wash yourself. But for 50 dirham you can get a \u0026ldquo;massage\u0026rdquo; which means that a guy washes you. Despite my embarassment, it seemed like a good idea, if only so I would not be alone and commit all kinds of faux paus in the hammam. The guy leads you to the steam room and you warm up there for a while. Then he comes and gets you for the washing. You wear bathing shorts, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean he is going to miss many spots. He pulls up your trunks and washes each cheek, but not between them! The washing includes an abrasive step where he takes off the dead skin. It is really amazing and though it is not painful it is uncomfortable when you are not used to it. The final step is a bunch of stretches they guy does by folding you into knots and then leaning on you. These would be ok if you were expecting them, but I was too shocked, confused, and apprehensive to enjoy them much. I will try again in a few days when I am good and dirty again.\nToday I saw the tanneries. My guide to find the tannery left me with the tannery guide, but promptly came back with a bundle of mint. They crushed it and gave it to me saying, \u0026ldquo;Moroccan gas mask\u0026rdquo;. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad, but I did use my gas mask some. The active ingredient in tanning Moroccan style is pigeon manure. But my guide kept calling it \u0026ldquo;pigeon shit\u0026rdquo; as though it was a technical term. I mostly used the gas mask to hide my grin. As is always the case, much complaining went on as I tried to pay only 5 euros for the guide. He wanted 15 euros. And of course the guide from the street that helped me find the tannery had to get his percent from me instead of from (or probably in addition to) the tannery guide. But I really enjoyed seeing it all.\nOne thing I learned is that the work conditions of the tanners is absolutely horrific. If you want to improve the world, do not buy Moroccan leather until they put in place some kind of fair trade and safe labor system for the workers. It has happened recently for other industries like coffee and cacao. The problem is that European and American tannery workers already got their press and their reforms back at the turn of the 19th century. Present day Moroccan tanners got skipped by history, I guess.\nDinner last night was nice. I was working my way through the stalls in the square picking a place to eat and enjoying watching the touts hassle other people. This cute girl got nabbed in front of me and the guy was selling the air conditioned comfort of the (outdoor) seating. She dodged the guy, putting the tout right in front of me and said, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I don\u0026rsquo;t need air conditioning but this guy (meaning me) was just telling me he wants it.\u0026rdquo; I gave her a dirty look which was quickly interrupted as she disappeqred behind the tout. After I got rid of my new best friend I caught up to the girl and told her, \u0026ldquo;Just for that, you have to accompany me to dinner!\u0026rdquo; She laughed and joined me. She had a simple soup and bread and I had lamb brochettes and various salads and sauces. A very nice and very cheap dinner.\nShe is a medical photographer for Operation Smile. She is in Morocco for a conference. It was interesting to compare our two NGO experiences, as they are related but quite different too. She was shocked at the realities of how bad healthcare is when the government is disrupted. Her experience is with functioning but poor health systems.\nI booked a four day tour today that will take me all the way out to the desert and back. I am considering hopping off the tour on the way back and taking my time at Ourzazate, but I guess I will see how it goes. So I will be off the net for a while and I will send an update next when I get back from that tour.\nFinally, just a little plug for my hotel, Hotel Essaouira. It is clean and has a fair price and the people are really friendly and helpful.

I know they need access to the pit to do that, so I told people to get ready to push the car off, and park it up the hill. They said, oh November 2, it will be heavy. We\u0026rsquo;ll need lots of guys. It\u0026rsquo;s too hot, and we\u0026rsquo;re too tired. We can\u0026rsquo;t move it. They gave me all kinds of excuses, but I was adamant\u0026hellip; the service had to go on, and I\u0026rsquo;d gather enough guys to push the Land Cruiser up the hill as we\u0026rsquo;ve done before. So I go get the radio operator, and the front gate guard. I come around the corner with my posse of car pushing dudes and the car is backing up the hill under it\u0026rsquo;s own power! The guys are all laughing because the quiplu thought the car had to be pushed.\nFor a moment I was completely confused. After all, I saw all the pieces of the rear differential laying on the bench. How can this be? Then it hit me\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s a four wheel drive vehicle. The front two tires were pushing it as it backed up the hill. Boy did I feel like an idiot.\nSo then I told them, \u0026ldquo;OK, if it can back up the hill, we can drive it around town while we are waiting for the parts to fix it!\u0026rdquo; That elicited a huge laugh because the drive shaft was audibly flopping around and gear oil was running out of the back differential, which didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a cover on it.

We had to make a Plan of Action, then we had to make the budget. The whole process was eye opening into how MSF plans its activities, and working on the budget was sometimes boring drudge work, but sometimes it was really interesting. I understand the MSF budget system much better now, and in the future I will be able to quickly see what work was envisioned by the previous people when I get to a new project. I put in a bunch of nifty things that I think the next log/admin will appreciate, including major repairs to the radios and some replacement equipment for stuff we have worn out.\nAll that work is done now so things are a little less busy. We have a lot of people taking annual leave because we have to get all the leaves finished before the end of the year. No one can carry over any time, which means you have to plan carefully, and really squeeze in any annual leave that was delayed or canceled for some reason. In order to save the new log/admin some pain, I have encouraged my two must important assistants to take time off now, even at the same time. Next week I will be all alone, but I know how to run things well enough by this point to cover for them.\nWe are out of car servicing hell, though we still have a lot of regular service to do, and they are all the difficult to plan ones that take a full week and happen down in Monrovia. So that means we have a few weeks without one of the cars, which is a pain. But I take it in stride now, and don\u0026rsquo;t get too worried about it. And most importantly, I schedule the car service first, then worry about the medical needs. I learned the hard way that broken cars don\u0026rsquo;t do anyone any good. Now I just smile and nod when they tell you that next week is a bad week to have one less car, then send the car to Monrovia anyway. We get along with the remaining cars, somehow.\nWe had another Lassa Fever suspect this week, but most of the team is well versed in what to do. We have two new people, so Susan made a big deal out of teaching them about it. \u0026ldquo;Never miss a learning moment,\u0026rdquo; my mother always says.\nWe have had two of our giggliest girls missing on training and vacation for several weeks, so meal times are quite a bit more quiet. That\u0026rsquo;s too bad. I miss the giggling.\nThe biggest news for me is that the second health post rehabilitation I was supposed to do was canceled. Another NGO showed up and started making a health post in that city. They will not provide a staff when they leave, which is a problem that MSF will look into solving, perhaps by working on finding another health NGO to work there. But that\u0026rsquo;s not my department, so I have much less construction related details to stress out about. We still have some construction to do, but it is much easier than a health post rehabilitation. I will hopefully go visit that project this week and will know more about it then.\nLast Wednesday was the official opening ceremony for Diallah Health Post, even though it has been in operation since October 17. The ceremony was nice, and short by Liberian standards. I gave a little speech. It had to be translated into Mano, so I kept it to about 3 sentences and each sentence was an easy to translate chunk. The general idea was that it was my job to bring resources from as far as Geneva and Monrovia, but we found the best resources were the cooperative people of Diallah who worked with us like brothers. And it really is true. It was a nice place to work. When I look at the water well at Diallah, it is clean and tidy, and the people follow all the rules just like the sign out front says. In other villages, the fence is all broken down and there are livestock walking around on the apron around the well, and babies are pooping in the street.\nMany times I walk around and see things like that and I just shake my head. A quote from the movie Clerks runs through my head, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of *\u0026amp;%*@ savages in this town.\u0026rdquo; But it\u0026rsquo;s not really true. Just like in suburban New Jersey, where Clerks was filmed, a few knuckleheads ruin things for everyone. The problem is that lack of access to education dramatically increases the number of knuckleheads, and what they impact is a matter of life or death (access to safe water in this case) instead of just an irritation (like gum in a padlock, in the case of Clerks).\nFor the record, the knuckleheads in Liberia do not put gum in padlocks. This is not out of a sense of civic duty regarding padlocks. Gum\u0026rsquo;s just pretty rare here.\nMy replacement has accepted the posting, and is now busily shutting down his life in Italy and packing to come here. He will arrive in Nimba December 5, and I will leave here December 12. I will fly back to Geneva and then have some meetings, then I am free until my mother comes to Geneva for Christmas. We will go to Prague and tour around some in Switzerland. She will return to the States in late December, then I will stay on in Geneva a bit longer to enjoy a one week visit to a ski chalet. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t manage to spend all my money, then I might plan another side trip to see friends in Germany. MSF will fly me from Geneva to New York, where I have a day of meetings with MSF USA. I might try to add in some time there to see New York and Boston friends. Then I will end up back in San Francisco sometime in late January or early February. After that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue what I will do, which is OK with me. I am not physically wiped out, like can sometimes happen from a really difficult mission. My patience level is certainly diminished, and I will spend all the time it takes to get bored and want to work again.\nI do want to work with MSF again, as soon as I am ready to work. But part of the reason I want to work for MSF again is so that I can see something different. The Liberian context is too much development and not enough emergency. And this is the worst kind of development, where things are so destroyed and the people are so dependent that it is impossible to really see anything that a normal person might consider progress. The kind of progress you see here is virtually impossible to differentiate from the background of severe poverty, breakdown in social cohesion, ignorance of basic life skills like hygiene and how to feed babies, and the virtual certainty (according to recent history) that it will all just be destroyed again in the next civil war. Committed, long-term development people can no doubt recognize the positive effects of development in leading indicators that they are (hopefully) monitoring, but I certainly can\u0026rsquo;t see much really constructive change in people\u0026rsquo;s behavior yet. The changes are all really hopeful ones, like school being in operation, people going back to finish elementary educations interrupted by the war, etc. But these are investments that take 5 to 15 years to mature. How will Liberia remain stable that long? The mind boggles. The odds, based on recent history, of 15 more years of stability are mind bogglingly small. But this is the brilliant thing about humans, we keep plugging along against the steepest odds.\nEmergencies happen in all kinds of contexts. The most vulnerable people, who MSF targets, are regrettably pretty much always in the kind of situation Liberians are in. But I know for sure, by talking to other MSF volunteers, that there are differences, and that other places to work give you very different MSF experiences. This one hasn\u0026rsquo;t been bad, but I would hate for it to be my only experience. And the stories I hear from other missions, though likely colored by time and distance, are much more hopeful and happy than what we deal with daily here. So I am looking forward to having more MSF experiences to compare with this one.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/11/18/busy-and-also-not-so-busy/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe were really busy here in October because of the need to plan 2007\u0026rsquo;s activities.

You have to accept that things might not happen the way you expect. It\u0026rsquo;s OK to maintain your standards, and explain what the minimum standards are, but after that it\u0026rsquo;s better to just embrace the zen of developing world construction and be pleasantly surprised with what you get. Of course, it helps immensely to have a long relationship with the workers and know from experience that you can trust them. It is a lot harder to achieve the zen state of acceptance when a bunch of people you have never worked with before start mixing concrete according to their own recipe, or ask for salt and laundry blue for the whitewash (both things that have happened to me).\nThe other nice thing with shutting up and just watching to see what they make is that sometimes you discover really nice details that people here know how to make. It is hard to describe any of these offhand, but there are benefits to approaching a construction project with a bunch of smart people and hand tools. They can adjust for problems in the material that a standardized approach, with power tools might not make allowances for. Everything here is a handcrafted work of art, to varying degrees of quality, depending on the needs.\nOk, it is off to lunch to enjoy a handcrafted meal of varying quality. We\u0026rsquo;ll see if it is red on white today, or maybe another exotic color on top of rice. My bet is on red though.\nPS: Happy Halloween, to those out there who know what it is.

The day went much better than could be expected, starting with the surprise arrival of the chief mechanic who fixed three cars today. It was not really a surprise, but it sort of felt like it, because he arrived on Saturday when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t around, and then came in to work on Monday morning and started waving his magic wrench around like a fairy sprinkling motor oil and fixing cars.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve had an ongoing, slow motion food crisis related to CSB, or Corn Soya Blend going for a while. We had some go bad, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t calculate very carefully, since we used to be drowning in the stuff. Turns out that once we had only 20 kg left, someone remembered it was about to be Groundhog Day and decided this time for a change to try telling me before something ran out. Ok, we\u0026rsquo;re making progress! I figured, no problem, it\u0026rsquo;s cheap and we only need a bit, we\u0026rsquo;ll just buy it in the market. But I called my food hustler, and he said, CSB is all out, in his store and all the stores. Oops. So like the grinch, I canceled breakfast on Saturday, to conserve food for the children in the TFC. Then I asked the medical staff to send home something else, anything else, than CSB that they normally send with the discharged TFC patients. I suggested cigarettes, which make you feel less hungry, but they settled on Plumpy Nut instead. This morning we had 7 kgs left, and I finally found 50 kgs of CSB in the marketplace. Yay! Better yet, tomorrow is market day, and I can be sure to find 100 kg more in the big market.\nI also spent a huge amount of time today in the WFP offices which are air conditioned, another gift. First I was begging for CSB (they left me hung out to dry on that) and then negotiating the next food delivery. The latter was one more birthday present. Because I came and brought all the details to my food monitor early, and was very cooperative, she was feeling generous. We worked through the numbers, and I told her which commodities I did not want, under any circumstances. 1400 kg of sugar, plus dry season equals a slick of melted sugar flowing out of the bags and across the stockroom. Not good. So she promised not to give me any sugar, a gift in itself. Then she asked me why I was always in her office begging for food when we had too much. I reminded her that sugar is not beans, and that I\u0026rsquo;m always begging for beans and oil (ok, except today, when I was begging for CSB). So she looked at the 200 kgs of beans and 200 kgs of oil that are in my stock now and said, \u0026ldquo;well, let\u0026rsquo;s just not subtract your current stock from your next order like we normally do.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;ok, thanks, nice seeing you, goodbye\u0026rdquo; in one breath and headed for the door before she could change her mind.\nA happy birthday indeed, when you get 400 kgs of food you are not expecting!\nAs for more conventional birthday presents, those are still in the mail to me. But I have a bunch of birthday cards, and the cook made me a cake for tonight.

It has been nice to get back to the normal schedule of Nimba life. None of the normal annoyances really bugged me because I was happy to be back \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo;. I started looking forward to the second half of my time here and realized that because I took my break a little late, the second half is actually only 7 weeks or so. And it was a strange feeling indeed to imagine that that won\u0026rsquo;t be enough time to get everything done. When I got here, the 6 months seemed like an eternity, but once I figured out how to keep the trains running on time I realized how little time there is for new work. And how few months to get it done in.\nOne nice thing that is happening here is that the economy in Saclepea is booming. People told me this in my briefing, but it has been nice to see while I have been here. Lots of new stores have been opening, and people are finishing houses left and right, adding previously luxurious touches like paint and cement pillars. Also, there are a huge number of new wheelbarrows in town, which I assume means that the vendors are doing a brisk business and upgrading their place of work. Nathalie and I were talking about this today. I told her that it did seem that the people really have all gotten tired of starting wars all at the same time, like an epidemic burning out. She pointed out that Liberians are lucky, because they do not have anyone bringing war to them right now. In Congo, where she worked last, she said the people were equally tired of war, but neighboring countries were bringing new combatants to the border and across it, who are all ready to fight to get whatever their political leaders convince them the war is for. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the war virus has burned out in the local population. A new strain comes flooding in from the environment and the antibodies seeking peace are overwhelmed.\nThis is why the regional wars that slosh back and forth across borders in West Africa are so destructive. If there is a built-in peace drive in human society triggered by the privations of continual war, it is disabled by war brought by \u0026ldquo;others\u0026rdquo;, because human society has a very strong mechanism for mobilizing against a threat from an outsider. This is the same mechanism that is so well understood by politicians all around the world, and used to keep people in fear and voting for them. If you have ever looked very closely at the \u0026ldquo;War on Terror\u0026rdquo; you will find the same system at work. There is in fact a serious terrorism problem, but the War on Terror is not aimed at the problem, just at maintaining a continuous state of fear.\nMy garden has been eaten by mold again. The growing conditions here, which seem so favorable, actually make it very difficult to grow vegetables. Even with tropical sun it takes a long time for vegetables to mature. The competing organisms like weeds and mold, have all that time to wreak havoc. And the quiplu seeds I brought with me have no immunity to the local pests. I have not put very much effort into gardening, because at the beginning I was too busy, and now I feel overwhelmed by the aggressive competitors here.\nI am beginning to make plans for Christmas and the rest of my life after Nimba. I will be in Geneva staying at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house. The only plan I have so far is a fabulous week of skiing in Switzerland, and eating lots and lots of cheese. I have plenty of new friends in Switzerland now, so I will also go to see some of my old Nimba family in their home towns. That will be pretty interesting. Eventually I will return to the States to see friends there, and maybe to head to Mexico to visit my parents. I use my Spanish from time to time here to translate, and it is clear I am losing it and need to go practice some.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/10/22/back-at-work/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis week was a regular work week for me, but a couple days were shaved off it while I was in transit back to Nimba.

The work is hard (even just one day has already presented a terrifying array of problems), but I am really happy to be back with the team and in my \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; bed. I brought back a new expat from Monrovia with me. Pierre is a Frenchman, an architect who worked in San Francisco for several years, and returned to France, then quit his job to work on real problems, instead of the somewhat unreal ones that architecture offered. He said that it annoyed him that people designed buildings that they do not know how to make. I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet if he knows how to make buildings, but I really like him and I think he will do well. His job is to build the replacement building for the pole and plastic sheeting hospital that I am supposed to keep limping along.\nI gave him the logistics briefing today. I gave him the security guideline to read, since the fieldco is not here, and then gave him some editorial comments, telling him which parts to memorize and which parts are generally ignored (or not really important in the current context of Liberia). When the fieldco gets back, he\u0026rsquo;ll get the full deal, but from me he got just enough not to get in trouble this week. I also taught him the rules for who rides in the cars, etc. And what things drivers are in charge of, and what things he is in charge of. Finally I taught him about our radios. It took a little longer than the 15 minutes I promised it would take, but not too much.\nOne of the interesting things about being a log I didn\u0026rsquo;t consider is that I am the hotelier for the staff. It is my job to have a comfortable room waiting for them (but not too comfortable\u0026hellip; this is MSF). In Pierre\u0026rsquo;s case, we had two rooms ready. I sold him on the best one, but he went and took the other one. Then he had the temerity to ask me to make some furniture that was missing in the crappy room, but present in the other room. I think I am going to like this guy. Temerity is a required asset for an MSFer!\nHanging out with medical people is interesting. I have long since ignored minor interruptions during dinner with snippets like \u0026ldquo;does the patient have discharge from her vagina?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the patient has no urine output\u0026rdquo;. I just smile and ask for more beer, thankful that I will later have plenty of urine output. But things have ratcheted up a notch because the HIV nurse found a new collection of photographs on one of the CDs she got in Geneva. The pictures of posters from around the world educating people on condom use were interesting. The worst ones are the genital skin lesions caused by the combination of STIs and AIDS. Yuck. At least it was only after dinner that I came to the office and found her looking at those.\nQuiplu the dog is happy to have me back, I think. At least he was eager to have my chicken bone tonight after dinner. He is excitable, by which I mean by jumping and acting like a maniac you can get him into a serious puppy mood, where he careens around the compound narrowly missing palm trees. Tonight I got him really spun up and running in circles around me. We were having a great time, and then he came straight at me. I was a little worried I\u0026rsquo;d finally pushed him too far and he was going to attack me, but what happened instead was even more surprising. He ran into me at full speed, bruising my shins painfully. I can only imagine what a terrible headache he got from it! He bounced off with a \u0026ldquo;yip!\u0026rdquo; and then stood still a while looking at me trying to figure out how and why I had put him so much pain. We made friends again within a few minutes (amnesia?) and he has no lasting effects that I can tell, not even a bruised ego.\nThe other new sensation that is sweeping the MSF compound in Nimba is Oware. This is the Ghanian name for the African game played with cups and balls. You pick up the balls and put them into the cups one at a time in a clockwise manner. If you land in a the opponent\u0026rsquo;s cup, and it has one or two balls, you get to keep their pieces. My grandparents have a board game up on the wall in their house that they picked up someplace in their travels, maybe in Morocco. (Later, I found out the game was from their time in the Philippines.) I bought an Oware game in Ghana, and brought it back, complete with an instruction booklet. So I have been teaching everyone, and they have been beating me soundly ever since. MSF attracts very, very smart people, despite what it make look like when a bunch of people forsake good jobs for snake hunting and cockroach-infested bucket showers.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/10/18/hello-from-nimba-again/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am back in Nimba now, back with my adopted family here. The work is hard (even just one day has already presented a terrifying array of problems), but I am really happy to be back with the team and in my \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; bed. I brought back a new expat from Monrovia with me. Pierre is a Frenchman, an architect who worked in San Francisco for several years, and returned to France, then quit his job to work on real problems, instead of the somewhat unreal ones that architecture offered. He said that it annoyed him that people designed buildings that they do not know how to make. I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet if he knows how to make buildings, but I really like him and I think he will do well. His job is to build the replacement building for the pole and plastic sheeting hospital that I am supposed to keep limping along.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Hello from Nimba again"},{"content":"I am back at Accra, at the same place I stayed in the first night. Not very adventurous, but it has Internet and hot water, and is in a nice neighborhood.\nHere is a quick list of things I did while I was here: bought some craft items, saw the fort at Cape Coast, walked on the catwalk at Kakama National Park, swam (pool and ocean), got a mild sunburn from being too relaxed to even notice, had a massage, listened to drums over a bonfire. I am leaving out the less-than-glamorous things that always happen in a week of traveling. It was a nice week, and I\u0026rsquo;m rested enough to go back to Nimba.\nI got some pretty strange culture shock by coming to Ghana. There is an electricity shortage here due to a drought. So the electricity goes off at odd times, which is different than Liberia, where if someone cares enough to pay for and install a generator, then it works. So in Liberia, a country without any electric system, the electricity was much more reliable than in Ghana. Also, Liberians use latrines. In the cities, I guess they use septic tanks. In Ghana, they use indoor plumbing. But the toilets drain to open sewers. It turns out I prefer latrines. I never really realized I have a preference, but traveling teaches you things about yourself, they say.\nI traveled for the first bit here, both because there were things in the guidebook that tempted me, and because I was looking for somewhere with the right comfort to price ratio. I had one really bad morning in Cape Coast when I realized I simply didn\u0026rsquo;t have the energy or patience for traveling. I looked in my book for the most expensive place I could find, hailed a taxi cab, took his first price (thereby overpaying by 5 times) and went directly there. I call it my \u0026ldquo;Out of Africa\u0026rdquo; moment, when I realized I really needed to be out of Africa, right then, immediately. The expensive hotel was OK, but was actually a disappointment in a number of ways. On the plus side, I was checked into a place with a clean bed and swimming in the pool within about 30 minutes of having my Out Of Africa moment, thereby saving my sanity from utter oblivion. On the negative side, the electricity was out for my entire stay there, which made some things like AC not work.\nThe restaurant was anemic. I ordered once and was told they didn\u0026rsquo;t have what I wanted. As a wise traveler, who was also on the edge of a nervous breakdown from things in Ghana not working right, I immediately said, \u0026ldquo;Well how about you just tell me what you CAN make.\u0026rdquo; The waiter seemed pleased that I was not going to make him say no a hundred more times. He told me they had some chicken. I asked, \u0026ldquo;Can you make the curried chicken?\u0026rdquo; and thankfully, he said yes.\nAfter one night at the super expensive place, I made a beeline for Big Milly\u0026rsquo;s Backyard, where I hid out for several more days, pretending I was someplace else than Ghana. It worked fine, and I am now delighted to be bqck in Accra, and tomorrow I will be delighted to be in Liberia.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/10/14/back-to-accra/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am back at Accra, at the same place I stayed in the first night.

I am on my vacation in Ghana and I thought I would give you all an update of what it islike to go from a post-conflict context to one of the richest countries in West Africa in 24 hours. In a few words, culture shock!\nThe culture shock started as we drove out of Nimba. I had been out as far as Phebe Hospital, where the two cars meet when we do a \u0026ldquo;kiss movement\u0026rdquo; which is where one car leaves from Monrovia and one from Nimba at the same time, then they both meet in the middle. I rode out to Phebe hospital with our normal driver, Elijah, and read my Lonely Planet for West Africa on the way. I played with a kid in the car (a patient with a broken leg, who I coincidently mett while riding in the car weeks ago), giving him my little Altoids container with a rock inside it to rattle, and also making a paper airplane for him. Then we tranferred into the car from Monrovia, and that\u0026rsquo;s when the culture shock started to set in.\nFirst, I was in a car I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been in for three months, not one of \u0026ldquo;my\u0026rdquo; cars. When it had a minor problem with water in the fuel, I felt curiously detached. I felt like a passenger, mildly annoyed that the taxi was broken, but trusting that the driver would get us back on the road quickly. (The mechanic happened to be along, and drained the water from the fuel filter and bled the fuel line, so we were in fact back on the road quickly.) I also felt a strange relief to be out of Nimba, but a much stronger yearning to be back with my teammates. As I willed myself to relax and just be on vacation, I actually came to tears, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know why. Certainly part of it was being proud of what all was finished, which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be tearful, but it was all my overloaded mind could think of to do. Strange feeling, but this is a strange job. I can only imagine how powerful and upsetting the feelings would be during an evacuation, when you had to leave people and jobs behind. Or worse, during an evacuation resulting from witnessing something really terrifying. I\u0026rsquo;ve read about what causes critical incident stress, but to feel the emotions from a normal, simple, scheduled departure from the project was way more powerful and confusing than I expected.\nLuckily, that was relatively over in a few hours, and I switched into starry eyed country hick let loose in the big city. I marveled at the streetlights (which were not even on yet, as it was 3 pm). The driver got a kick out of the fact that I thought streetlights were remarkable\u0026hellip; but I could tell he was actually still proud of them, as his city had been without them for 15 years until just this August. I also finally got a better feel for the city, as this time I was able to pay attention to the city layout, instead of being distracted by all the new experiences of being an MSFer (riding in the Land Cruiser, hearing the radio, seeing the MSF flag, etc). This time I was just a passenger with a good driver, and I could actually learn about Monrovia.\nI had a nice afternoon in Monrovia, but experienced a problem I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed before. Life in the capital team is much different than in little Nimba. People have friends outside of the team, and team members have spouses (or significant others) and don\u0026rsquo;t really pay attention to you as a guest. Instead, you are like a customer in a hotel, and left to yourself. In my somewhat fragile state having just left Nimba, it was unsettling, but I know why life is that way in the capital team, and I would never demand that they drop everything and pay attention to me. Well, ok, I did a little. I told several people that I wanted to go out to dinner, and laid a bit of a guilt trip on them about how it was my first night in Monrovia in 3 months, and that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to go out to dinner alone. I got my boss and his wife to take me out to a great pizza place which happened to have live music that was not totally offensive and really great pizza. I flew out the next morning (this morning) at 11 am.\nArriving in Ghana was fun, because it is like Mexico. Halfway between Liberia and Europe. I dealt with the crazy taxi people at the airport with some amount of dignity, getting a fair price into my hotel. I walked directly to my hotel, and as a nice bonus met a nice girl from England on the way. Then the hotel gave me a discount because I work for MSF. I went out in search of food, and found a nice fast food place. We will see tonight if it was serving safe food or not!\nThe girl, Rosalind, and I had a nice evening together. This is her first time in Africa, so I took her on a walk and then took her to a pub. I got to play the experienced Africa expat card, which was kinda fun. She\u0026rsquo;s a smart cookie and will figure it all out soon enough. She certainly appreciated having someone to learn from.\nOK, out of time, so I have to send this. Tomorrow I have no plans, but will figure it out over breakfast.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/10/09/hello-from-ghana/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0026rsquo;ve made it to (and past) the halfway point.

Things have not been super busy, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt too much like writing.\nThis week a logistics helper came from Monrovia and completed a renovation of the building that used to be our food store into a new office building. After we finish moving out of the office this week, we will have more bedrooms for both the new expat arriving soon, and for guests. Right now, there are no rooms in the inn. I kept the rehabilitation plans really simple in order to get them done fast. I had planned to leave the wood trim unpainted and only whitewash the walls. But it turned out that we had some white paint left over from the health post renovation at Lepula. So I gave the team that paint to use. Then they complained that you can\u0026rsquo;t paint the walls white and the trim white. Fashion nazis! So we dug around some more and found some Jade Green paint that was also incorrectly bought for Lepula. Ministry of Health standard for health posts in Liberia is whitewashed walls with Forest Green trim, so the Jade Green was right out. I gave them that to mix with the white. The result is a shade of green that reminds me of the United States Forest Service every time I see it. Everyone really likes the new office because of the green windows and doors. They are pretty snazzy, actually.\nColors aside, the office itself is going to be a major disappointment. The building is too small. We went around and around trying to make a good plan for expanding the residence and moving the office and never came up with something that made everyone happy. The best I could suggest was to make bungalows for people to live in, and expand the office into some of the residence. But that met with stiff resistance from people who feel like it is unhealthy to have the office and the residence in the same building. (Obviously these people have never worked for a Silicon Valley startup.) Fair enough. So instead we have a very small office with lots of little rooms that are a little difficult to put furnishing in, not only because the floor plan is small, but because the hallway and doors are so small the furniture won\u0026rsquo;t fit. And if you do tip something sideways and get it in the door, then the ceilings are too low to let you tip it up again. Luckily the Liberian ceiling construction is flexible, so you can push the furniture up into the ceiling to make it fit. It seems like maybe I will have the carpenters here this week modifying the furniture to make it possible to move it in. What a hassle.\nThis Saturday I leave for my vacation. It is supposed to be in Ghana, but I have not gotten confirmation about my plane flight. Hopefully everything is lined up. I sent my passport down to Monrovia a while ago to get my visa, so I\u0026rsquo;ve done everything I can from this side. I still don\u0026rsquo;t really have a clue what I will do when I get there, but I have good suggestions from my family who researched it online, and I also have a guide book I will read on the 6 hour drive to Monrovia.\nWe continue to have minor livestock crises. The cute little chicks have grown into unholy terrors who are pooping all over the patio. So we are sending them to the place where our goat is as a thank you for taking care of the goat. Jeff the goat will come back to MSF and be the main dish in Jerome\u0026rsquo;s going away party. Today I heard a huge noise by where the another chicken had made her nest in a little box. I looked in and found two newly hatched chicks, a lizard, and a really mad hen. I have no idea where the lizard came from, but it was about as scared as the chicks, and it was getting one hell of a beating from the hen. We held down each of them with sticks and then threw the lizard out. I have not checked on the chicks, but I assume they are OK.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve had some pretty bad generator problems in the hospital, which is a pain, because of course people only notice it is not working at night. Somewhat embarrassingly, the last time we had the problem one of my watchmen started turning off lights as an experiment to see if overloading was the problem. Guess what? It was. I\u0026rsquo;m remembering now that the mysterious generator problems started about the time we added a bunch of new light bulbs. It turns out that we had a miscommunication. I thought the instructions the electrician was working under were, \u0026ldquo;fix up the system to be more reliable and add lights, but only if the system can handle the additional load\u0026rdquo;. What he did was add lights wherever anyone asked for one. So we have a bunch of new lights and an overloaded generator. So now I get to go be the bad guy and disconnect a bunch of lights. We are using a much more powerful diesel generator for the time being, and that\u0026rsquo;s postponing the real fix. Probably the easiest answer is to just throw money at the problem and buy a bigger generator for the hospital that can handle the load we have now. Part of the reason lots of things in the hospital are less than perfect is that people always say, \u0026ldquo;the new hospital will be finished soon, so don\u0026rsquo;t fix this one\u0026rdquo;. But the construction project is way way behind schedule, or it would be if the plans were not changing so fast that there could be an actual schedule. (Later, I got permission to just keep the powerful generator, so I did not have to take away any lights. Yay!)\nWhat brought this all to a head the other day was that the diesel generator had two problems in one day. First, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t start. I suspected that the fuel lines had air in them, so I called my head driver to see if he knew how to fix small diesel engines. He said no. My mechanic was in Monrovia, so he was no help. So I gathered a bunch of tools and went over there feeling much less confident than I looked. (This is the normal state of an MSF log, I\u0026rsquo;m assured by experienced ones.) I examined the generator closely and found the starting instructions that I\u0026rsquo;d glanced at before. It turns out that there\u0026rsquo;s some extra steps to starting a small diesel engine that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about, as all the small engines I\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with before are gasoline ones. So I followed the instructions, and sure enough it started right up. The watchmen who called me for help had been following my old (wrong) instructions.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this saying that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Think about the generator story from the point of view of my watchmen. They can\u0026rsquo;t start it, so they call me on the radio. I come and invoke a hitherto unknown technology among the watchmen called, \u0026ldquo;reading and following directions\u0026rdquo;, and then do something different than what I taught them, and the generator starts. They must think I am a wizard with a magic wand that starts generators.\nI made a new starting instructions sheet, translating from the small sticker that won\u0026rsquo;t stay on the fuel tank because they slop diesel on it, into Liberian English. Also, somehow instructions printed on MSF letterhead have more force (like the word of God) and get followed when the same instructions on the side of an engine are treated like decoration.\nThe second problem was that the generator developed a bad noise. They called on the radio and told me they wanted to stop the generator, leaving the camp without power. I agreed, and then went over to listen to the noise myself and decide how bad it really was. It turned out to be a broken engine mount, which I knew about before, but had been ignoring, hoping it would somehow fix itself. (Well, also, the parts are really hard to get for this generator, so I figured we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a replacement anyway.) I made a replacement engine mount out of a rag and some copper wire, and gave them the green light to use the generator again. This week I will have the mechanic make a replacement for the rag and copper wire out of an old tire.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this upcoming vacation. I think I need the rest for sure. But I\u0026rsquo;m kind of wondering how being gone for a week will really make a difference. I\u0026rsquo;m also not looking forward to all the travel necessary to get out of Nimba and onward to some nice resort outside of Accra. The vacation also marks the halfway point of my work here, and I\u0026rsquo;m also not sure how I feel about that. On the one hand, it means I have the same amount more work to do, which seems like an awful lot, and that it would be sort of nice if I could just go back to Geneva directly from Ghana. On the other hand, it means that the end is in sight, and all the people and things that I like about this place will soon just be a memory. Already, we will lose one of our team, Jerome, in the next two weeks. I really like him, and will miss listening to him parrot my English. His favorite thing he learned from me is \u0026ldquo;you-gotta-be-kidding-me\u0026rdquo;. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice that I say it, but he listened and learned it, and then used it one day. It was like hearing an echo of myself, he did it so well. Then he wanted to know what it was he\u0026rsquo;d just said, since he couldn\u0026rsquo;t really understand the words\u0026hellip; he was just parroting the idiom as pronounced fluidly by me.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/10/01/im-still-alive/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJust a quick note to tell you all that I am still alive.

Things are difficult in a hospital made of poles and plastic sheeting in the best of times, but with an influx of 15 to 20 injured people at night, it can get ugly fast. Luckily Emir (our doctor) is really good at handling situations like that. The team works together really well, and we all know our specialties well and how to anticipate problems, so it\u0026rsquo;s exciting, but not utter pandemonium,\nThe first one came a few weeks ago with no warning. The Physician Assistant on duty at the hospital called on the radio around 9 or 10 pm as we were all getting ready for bed. He said he had 14 newly arrived cases at the Emergency Room and that there was another car coming. The accident that injured all these people was due to a big truck running off a bridge and plunging into a creek. We never really got a credible report of what happened, but the rumor going around was that 7 people were known to be dead at the accident scene, and that 4 more bodies were pulled out of the creek in the morning. When Emir got the call, I went to Lilian\u0026rsquo;s room and told her Emir would probably want her help. Then I went to get on the radio and talk with the camp guards. Our hand-held radios are at their limit of reception, so it helps a lot to have an operator at the main radio at base who can relay messages. Because the radio room is next to the Field Coordinator\u0026rsquo;s room, she also got up. So the medical people gathered up supplies like extra gauze, gloves, and tetnus vaccine and headed out. Emir used the big open space of the outpatient clinic waiting room as a triage area, and then moved patients through our single ER one at a time. There are electric lights in the ER, but not in the triage area, so I imagine there was a fair amount of scrambling for flashlights and batteries. One great decision Emir made was to have me immediately get a taxi waiting at the hospital. After his initial assessment, he loaded the taxi with the worst cases who needed the least stabilization and sent them to Ganta. So within 15 minutes, he\u0026rsquo;s already gone from 14 patients to 11. We ended up sending a second taxi that night with more patients.\nLast night around 5:30 pm, we got a call that an accident had injured 30 people nearby and we were asked to go pick up the patients. We don\u0026rsquo;t run an ambulance service, so we have to say no to those requests. But sometimes there are extenuating circumstances, so we keep our mind open. Getting one call about 30 injured people jolts you to attention, but also makes you ask, \u0026ldquo;is that real information, or a rumor?\u0026rdquo; So you start asking around, emphasizing that what you heard in unconfirmed, etc. Due to turnover on both sides, we don\u0026rsquo;t have really great contact info for UNMIL and Civpol (the UN-operated civilian police service). We did find a number for a Merci person in Nimba. They have an ambulance that sometimes drops patients at our hospital, so I asked them to go see what was going on beyond Bahn where the accident reportedly was. I was also tracing the progress of one of our vehicle home from Lepula, and I realized too late to warn them that they would be passing the accident site. Luckily, they found the injured people and poor Jerome (outreach/bush nurse) found himself in the middle of about 200 Liberians freaking out and all wanting a ride to Saclepea on the MSF car. He assessed the patients and chose the 2 that he could take. Unfortunately, by the time Jerome was on the scene and could give us accurate information that would have allowed us to send a car to help him, it was too late to send a car because they don\u0026rsquo;t drive outside of Saclepea at night. So Jerome did the best he could with the space he had.\nAt base, we scurried around gathering supplies. It was clear that we learned a lot from last time by how well organized people were. I realized I had all the stuff I needed easily available to make a lighting system in the triage area, so I went along with the medical staff carrying all my lights and cables. I grabbed one of the watchmen and started setting up the lights. They were ready about 30 seconds before Jerome arrived with his patients. Like last time, I arranged to have a taxi standing by. Everything went smoothly, too smoothly. Of course because we were so well prepared, the 30 patients didn\u0026rsquo;t really materialize. After Jerome arrived with his two patients, another truck came carrying quite a few more patients. The head PA arrived from town, and had picked up a number of other medical staff he\u0026rsquo;d seen in central town along the way. There was almost one PA per patient, which made the assessments go fast. The injuries were minor, or at least not the super-dramatic open femur fractures that are the real nightmares.\nWhen we got home, Emir thanked me for the lighting system, and said it made a real difference. I\u0026rsquo;m now considering how to arrange for the emergency lighting system to be ready to deploy for the future. I think I will add a plug to the electrical system nearby and then stockpile the lights, extension cord, and power strip in a box at the base. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably put some instructions in it, because the problem is that there\u0026rsquo;s a chance that by the time I have it ready to use, there will be no more emergencies. The next log will need it someday and have to figure it out on the fly. Hopefully marking it clearly and putting the instructions in will help.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/09/19/er/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTwice now, we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten huge numbers of injured people from vehicle accidents.

The storekeeper came to me really agitated. He said that he\u0026rsquo;d gone in the food store to check that things were ready to deliver food on Monday. But when he opened the door he found a big snake. He showed me that it was as big as his forearm. Now, we have snake scares from time to time. It results in a frenzy of activity, as all the expats run for digital cameras, and the Liberians who grew up in the bush get their slingshots, cutlasses and sharp sticks ready, and all the city boys from Monrovia scream like girls. I tend to try to steer clear of the circus and watch the country boys to make sure that the snake is dispatched swiftly and safely.\nFirst, a word on MSF Nimba Project snake policy. The policy is, \u0026ldquo;we kill them\u0026rdquo;. As an addendum to the policy, we let the watchmen eat them if they want. The problem with the snakes is that only some of them are poisonous, but those that are, are really poisonous. In fact, they are so poisonous, the treatment protocol for snakebite is, \u0026ldquo;if they are alive when they get to the hospital, treat the symptoms because he\u0026rsquo;ll survive anyway\u0026rdquo;. (With a little imagination, you can figure out the other half of that \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo;.) Since not all of them are deadly, it\u0026rsquo;s not fair to kill them all. But the problem is that finding someone in the heat of the moment who knows if a snake is safe to leave in the compound is impossible. So every snake sighting turns into a snake hunt.\nSo Isaac reports a snake. We have an hour or so before sundown. Isaac is not really hot on snakes, but I can tell from the way he is acting that this is a serious snake, over a meter. The other ones we have killed have been a meter tops, sometimes only 50 centimeters. The problem with the food store is that there are pallets, and so there are lots of snake hiding places. There are several rooms, but right now we know which room it is in, so we need to act fast and take advantage of the knowledge. The food store won\u0026rsquo;t be safe until we find and kill the snake. The other problem with a food store is that even the best food store has a few mice, and mice are snake food. So it\u0026rsquo;s not like the snake is going to just mosey on out of the snake buffet without a little help from a cutlass.\nAs I said, when the circus atmosphere takes over, I do my best to watch and see how I can keep it reasonably safe. I try to follow the lead of the person who decides what to do and then starts doing it. We checked to see if James the watchman was around, because he\u0026rsquo;s the great hunter. He usually steps up to the challenge of all the hunting needed in the base. Alas James was not going to be on duty until after dark, and it was clear that I needed to find another hunter. Luckily a driver/watchmen named Diago stepped up to the plate and started poking under the pallets with a long stick. We called for a flash light and tried to look in from the doorway. Diago couldn\u0026rsquo;t do much with the stick form the doorway. This is when things stalled. Diago didn\u0026rsquo;t have any more ideas, and I was left holding the flashlight.\nOne of the things I learned in log school is that the key to effective leadership is to keep people thinking that there\u0026rsquo;s always something you know how to do that they don\u0026rsquo;t, and that they should listen to you. Usually, bravado and a smooth tongue can maintain the proper level of respect. Sometimes however, you can\u0026rsquo;t fool the crowd and you actually have to show some real leadership instead of just bluffing. I realized this was one of those rare moments. So, in I went, flashlight in hand.\nThe nice thing about pallets of food all lined up in a warehouse is that they form a grid underneath them. When you are on your knees looking under them with a flashlight, they line up in rows and columns. You can eliminate a lot of territory by working your way through the place checking rows and columns. So I worked my way in looking for the snake, crawling on my hands and knees. About halfway through the room I found a tiny piece of the snake, luckily just a piece out of the middle. Not too intimidating. And it was easy to tell where I would find the rest. So I screwed up my courage and checked the next row, and there it was. It was really big. Way bigger than any we\u0026rsquo;d seen before. Isaac was right, and I was glad we\u0026rsquo;d found it. But now I had a problem\u0026hellip; how to kill it. I regrouped outside and explained what I\u0026rsquo;d seen to Diago. With more information, Diago was willing to come inside with me. First though, he cut the stick down, using the cutlass expertly. He made it into a spear, even going so far as to take off the little knots on the edge so it could slide through the pallets easily. Either that or he was just trying to kill time tpo avoid going back in the building with me. When the stick was as ready as it would ever be, we returned to the warehouse and I shined the light while he got ready to stick the snake. The sharp stick is not to kill it, but to hold it in one place, it turns out. Once he was lined up, he poked it against the back wall with a quick thrust and the snake got very angry, very fast.\nI hopped up and started moving boxes. Richard the radio operator jumped into the act and helped me tunnel towards the snake. We had to remove about 12 boxes to get to it. The first few were no problem, but the closer I got to the bottom of the stack and the snake, the more careful I had to be to grab the box and get out of there. Diago held the snake firmly and we exposed it. Adolphus came in with a cutlass for the kill. The snake was whipping around and Adolphus was trying to cut it\u0026rsquo;s head through the slats of the pallet, which is not easy. I was yelling for a second stick, since it turned out that Diago didn\u0026rsquo;t have very good control of the snake after all. The snake foolishly lined his head up with the slats for a second and Adolphus finished it off with the front of the cutlass, which is squared off. The blade came down between two slats of wood like a guillotine, and the snake was in two pieces. Happily the head only had a few inches of body attached, which made it unable to move much. The rest of the body was going all over the place, but without the head, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of.\nThis is the part of snake killing that gets scary. The problem is that the Liberians like to poke at and otherwise taunt the head, and the head of the snake is still intent on killing someone, body or none. So you have to clear out until they crush the jaw, and then it\u0026rsquo;s a bit safer. So I ran for cover, mostly because the whole thing was really creeping me out by that point and I just wanted to get the heck away. Diago held up the body, and it was as tall as him\u0026hellip; over 1.70 meters. It even had a mouse in it\u0026rsquo;s belly, making it look all the more gruesome. Many pictures were taken. Diago was proud to be in most of them.\nAfterwards, as all the adrenalin was draining away I gave all my fellow snake killers a well deserved soda and toasted them all. Richard commented in his Liberian way, \u0026ldquo;Jeff is BRAVE! No one would go in to find the snake, but Jeff did!\u0026rdquo;. I ought to be able to get some mileage out of that for a few weeks! Then I\u0026rsquo;ll have to climb up on a roof and adjust an antenna or do something else dramatic to impress the locals. Tough crowd, these logistics staffers.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/09/15/jeff-is-brave/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday we had a little excitement in the compound. The storekeeper came to me really agitated. He said that he\u0026rsquo;d gone in the food store to check that things were ready to deliver food on Monday. But when he opened the door he found a big snake. He showed me that it was as big as his forearm. Now, we have snake scares from time to time. It results in a frenzy of activity, as all the expats run for digital cameras, and the Liberians who grew up in the bush get their slingshots, cutlasses and sharp sticks ready, and all the city boys from Monrovia scream like girls. I tend to try to steer clear of the circus and watch the country boys to make sure that the snake is dispatched swiftly and safely.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"\"Jeff is BRAVE!\""},{"content":"The TFC is the Therapeutic Feeding Center, where severely malnourished patients can be fattened up. This is significantly harder than it sounds since it turns out that human bodies do not take well to severe starvation. As you put in fluids and carbohydrates, the body needs to adjust and deal with the new chemical balances. You can kill a person by feeding them. So the medicine in the TFC is actually a specialty, like urology or proctology, but less icky. Unfortunately for all the malnourished people in Africa, it is also a rare specialty, so we here in Saclepea are just sort of doing our best to run the TFC according to the books the experts in Europe wrote and sent to us. There\u0026rsquo;s a certain amount of \u0026ldquo;if it works, don\u0026rsquo;t change it\u0026rdquo;, which is OK, but can be dangerous if things aren\u0026rsquo;t actually working, but you don\u0026rsquo;t understand what\u0026rsquo;s happening enough to be able to tell.\nOf course, when you have clinically malnourished people in a community you\u0026rsquo;ve got to first ask the question, \u0026ldquo;why aren\u0026rsquo;t they eating?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s better to take a public health perspective and solve that problem first, lest 100 more people arrive next week on the verge of death. Of course, there are entire NGO\u0026rsquo;s organized around that question. When you are writing proposals to the funders, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;food security\u0026rdquo;. As an aside, making sense of the whole vocabulary of NGO\u0026rsquo;s is like walking in a house of mirrors with a blindfold on. Like any other essentially political activity, it all changes every decade or so based on the direction of the political winds. There is a sign in a little tiny village on the way to Lepula that says, \u0026ldquo;Building capacity in maternal mortality and child survival\u0026rdquo;. This in a village without a school, and a literacy rate that is probably less than 25%. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be better if the sign said, \u0026ldquo;Helping mothers and kids to not die\u0026rdquo;? Or if the money used to pay for the sign was used instead to help mothers and kids to not die? Just a thought.\nAnyway, MSF doesn\u0026rsquo;t do Food Security. We just fix people who are malnourished and hope someone else will make it so that less of them come to us, so we can close down the TFC and get on with more pressing issues, like teaching Quiplu the dog to fetch. (not gonna happen, it seems)\nOur TFC has only kids in it. This is a reflection of the current context in Liberia. Children are ending up malnourished in Liberia due to a number of reasons, but rarely is the reason \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s no food to eat\u0026rdquo;. This might seem surprising, but consider some other possibilities. A lot of children who are three right now were conceived during the war. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but the next time I\u0026rsquo;m in a war, I\u0026rsquo;m not planning on starting a family. Some of these 3 year olds are the products of rapes, or less violent but still unwanted sex (for instance, sex as a survival strategy, in order to get food, or protection). These children are unwanted, and there is no orphanage system in Liberia to help the mothers deal with them, so some mothers are overwhelmed and de-prioritze the unwanted children among the others who are products of happier times. Another possibility is that these are children of 15 year old orphans, who are missing the family structure of mothers, grandmothers, and aunts who might be able to explain nursing and child rearing to them. It takes a tiny amount of time for a healthy child with diarrhea who stops eating to get malnourished. Also, due to the poor state of health care here, mothers could have an undiagnosed condition that keeps them from producing enough milk, like dehydration and anemia due to low level malaria infection. If we had some Food Security experts here, they could drive up in shiny new Land Cruisers and give us a snazzy PowerPoint presentation explaining which of these factors are at work here. I suppose they are doing that in some UN meeting, but it\u0026rsquo;s not my problem.\nNow that I have you totally depressed, I should get back to the topic: Toys for the TFC. We are working on improving and decentralizing our TFC in order to align our project with the current winds that are blowing through the relief industry. By shifting towards outpatient therapeutic feeding, you can cover many more children with the same amount of money. This is a good thing, but it requires that Susan, our fieldco, figures out what\u0026rsquo;s currently happening in the TFC and then makes a plan to change it. She started reading the MSF nutrition books and found out that after a child is out of the severe malnutrition phase, it is a good idea to stimulate them with toys. This is actually head-slappingly obvious when you see the TFC, which is a place where the patients and the caretakers sit for 12 hours and basically do two things, eat and wait (the other 12 hours are spent in the night TFC ward, where they do three things: eat, wait, and sleep). The waiting is for the next meal. So clearly this would be a good place to have some toys.\nAbout this time I realized that my mom sent the long balloons you can make balloon animals out of in a care package. (She does weird things like that. Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m the weird kid who thanked her for the balloons, then asked for a pepper grinder. We clearly deserve each other.) So I made some balloon animals, and they were a big hit. I need to teach the other expats how to do that, so that we can keep a constant supply of balloon animals coming into the TFC. Mom has already airlifted an emergency supply of balloon animals to Geneva, which will arrive when Susan gets back from Geneva.\nThe problem with the balloon animals is that they pop. So I started thinking about wood toys. On Sunday, my only day off, I try to schedule some work with my hands that is not mind work. Sometimes it is fixing little things that I notice are broken during the week. This weekend, I decided to make wooden toys. I started off with a Land Cruiser pull toy, which was a great success. Then I moved to building blocks, which were too much trouble to cut out of the hard tropical wood we have here using the hand saw. So after only 6 of those, I moved on to blocks with holes and a spindle to stack them on. That went pretty well. So with an afternoon of work, I had three prototypes. We took them in to the TFC on Monday, and they were popular. The MSF Land Cruiser pull toy has not made it\u0026rsquo;s debut because the paint was still drying. I noticed tonight that it is dry, so Jerome can draw on the MSF logo, and some other details to make it a Land Cruiser. I think the snorkel will have to go on, as it is very distinctive. I put a big HF antenna and tuner on it, which is a trademark of NGO cars here. The HF radios can communicate hundreds of kilometers, even out in the bush, so we use them to stay in touch instead of trying to use VHF repeaters on towers like a fleet of vehicles might do back in the US. The HF antennas are really distinctive, and are easy to model with a little wire. You just strip the insulation off the top part to be the antenna and leave the insulation on the bottom to be the tuner. Et viola!\nI just realized that the sticks in the forest next to our compound would make really excellent Lincoln Logs, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that the kids are old enough for that type of toy. Perhaps some sort of coconut-based rattle would be nice. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to get a coconut with only water inside. The coconuts here have lots of white flesh, which will rot if I just drain the water. This will take some thinking.\nAfter I exhausted myself making toys with the hand tools our carpenters use all day effortlessly, Hugo mentioned that the construction site has power tools. So this weekend, Hugo and I will set up an assembly line and maybe get Jerome to help us make some more toys for the TFC. It should be a fun weekend project!\nOne more quick thing. Ever wonder where the big advertising banners go when the campaign is over? Like the kind in Times Square? Well, it turns out they end up in Liberia on top of trucks as tarps. Normally, they are probably inside out, advertising boring stuff like soap to the bags of rice inside. But the other day one caught my eye. Remember the Dove Soap ads with the real women, not stunning supermodels on them? Just a bunch of nice ladies standing around in their bras and panties? Well there is a truck on the road in Nimba with them on it, and the driver chose to put them right side out, so that the Dove women are riding along on top of the truck. Certainly required a doubletake!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/09/12/toys-for-tfc/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe TFC is the Therapeutic Feeding Center, where severely malnourished patients can be fattened up.

It has been threatening to rain all day, and getting muggier and muggier, so it is nice that the rain and the cool breezes have finally come. It means, of course, that when I am done writing this and try to send it, it will fail because the satellite signal is blocked, but this is a small inconvenience to trade for the cool breeze coming through the office.\nAfter a couple months in Liberia I have mastered enough of the lingo to be accepted as a native speaker of English, instead of an incomprehensible foreigner. Likewise, I usually understand people, even when they are talking to others instead of directly to me. Liberians with long experience working in NGOs know how to speak English to foreigners, and will occasionally translate for us. The key difference is a combination of word choice, grammar, and word endings. In casual Liberian English, the word endings are gone, making it pretty hard to reconstruct what word from standard English they meant. When it comes time for a Liberian to write down a word, if they don\u0026rsquo;t know the spelling and choose to write it phonetically, you can actually SEE that the end of the word is completely lost. The grammar used by casual Liberian speech is the simpler grammar found around the world. This version of English is like the welding or masonry or carpentry of the developing world. A little rough around the edges, but exactly what is needed to get the job done, and nothing more. And in case that sounds condescending, remember that I love the engineering of the developing world, where everything is out where you can see how it works, and any parts that are not needed broke and were removed years ago. This is casual Liberian English, and it works great. Most educated Liberians can switch into standard English in a heartbeat, and they know they need to do so to make themselves understood to foreigners.\nLike everywhere where English is spoken, there are local words, or much more confusing to an outsider, local meanings for standard English words. One fun one is the verb to embarrass, which means to disrupt, make untidy, or annoy. When I first got here I asked Roger to arrange to have a huge pothole filled because the water in it was always messing up the cars as they came and went from the compound. As the waste water from the small lake was going to cross someone else\u0026rsquo;s property, he wanted to get permission from the mayor, and took me along. He said, \u0026ldquo;we want to drain the puddle because it embarrasses our vehicles\u0026rdquo;. Another funny example was a message that came over the radio one night: \u0026ldquo;Please bring diesel fuel to the hospital to waste around because there are driver ants that are embarrassing the patients.\u0026rdquo; In Liberian English, to waste is to spread something (however wastefully or frugally). A man clears land then wastes rice seeds over it. We wasted a whole lot of diesel fuel on the ants that night, let me tell you. In the morning, I told the storekeeper what we did and he carefully wrote on the stock card, \u0026ldquo;8 gallons of diesel fuel for ants in hospital\u0026rdquo;.\nEverything is justified to the last dollar and gallon around here. I spent an enjoyable few minutes the other day looking for an accounting code to list the LRD 20 (about 50 cents US) that I spent on a pair of bowls for feeding the dog and cat. I settled on \u0026ldquo;expat residence expenses\u0026rdquo; reasoning that Quiplu is pretty much one of the expats now, and Dude the cat only ever eats, as far as we can tell, if we put something dead in a bowl for him. I keep explaining to him that American cats would love the opportunity to eat the kinds of moths and bugs he has here, but he just walks away.\nBack on the topic of Liberian words for a second\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Fine\u0026rdquo; is used like \u0026ldquo;uh huh\u0026rdquo; when someone else is talking\u0026hellip; so if they are saying something you generally agree with you utter a string of \u0026ldquo;fine\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fine\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fine\u0026rdquo; sotto voce along with them to show you are following them. This is pretty distracting until you get used to it, but now I do it some when listening to Liberians. Hopefully, like getting into the wrong side of a car when I try to drive it, this will be an easy habit to drop when I get home.\nToday I got Lilian and Desma to cut my hair. The guys in town do an OK job of cutting hair, but I just wanted a buzz cut and Hugo brought what a Liberian would probably call a shaving machine (anything mechanical is called a machine, like the pumps and generators), so I decided to get my hair cut at the MSF barbershop. A good time was had by all, and I cleverly scheduled my shower right after the haircut, so the little pieces of hair that were stuck to my sweaty skin are all gone now. Ick.\nWhen you are the administrator, there are a thousand places to sign your name every day. The same holds true for a logistician, who approves expenditures of the material variety. So as a log/admin, I have about two thousand signatures to do a day. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned the benefit here of carrying a distinctive pen. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be expensive or anything, but everyone knows now what my pen looks like, and if I start to leave their desk and it is still there, they call me back for it. It is absolutely incredible to consider it, but I am still using the same pen today that I was using when I got here, over 2 months ago. I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to worry that it will run out of ink, and I will have to train everyone what my new pen looks like. My current pen is a promotional one I got from Telenor at the Humaninet Demonstration Day in June that\u0026rsquo;s got puppy teeth marks on the end from Kat. I was looking at it closely during a really boring staff meeting (yes, even in Africa you can\u0026rsquo;t escape boring meetings) and it turns out it is Swiss-made, which is fitting, as I work for MSF Switzerland.\nUpdate: It turns out that I did in fact run the pen out of ink, which is a first in my life, I think. I had a troublesome few days until I settled on a new pen with the help of Marina, who had brought an amazing collection of pens with her from an aunt. She was supposed to be giving them to children, but she gave one to me too. Marina also brought a special pen for me from Barcelona after her training session, but I immediately lost that one, which made me very sad. Getting attached to pens in the bush is not an effective use of the finite energy available for emotions.\nMy work is completely under control right now. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say that it won\u0026rsquo;t careen dangerously out of control on Monday morning with broken radios, lost vehicles, and water and food shortages. But on Saturday evening, I sat down to have a beer and de-stress and realized I wasn\u0026rsquo;t stressed. The accounting closed on time, and no money is missing (though I had some really big scares this month, which taught me to be more careful about everything I learned the first month). The health post rehab project in Diallah is going great. WFP assures me they will be delivering food next week, as long as I get this stupid report done tonight and take it to them in the morning. And I moved a radio over from one car to another, giving us 3 cars for use in the bush again, since last week I found out one of our bush cars needs major transmission work and is no longer allowed outside of Saclepea. On Saturday evening I did have one little fly in the ointment, which is that the front sway bar on one vehicle has broken loose and needs to be fixed. Luckily, that part of the suspension breaks the most around here, so just by looking at it, I could tell it will be a 2 hour fix. I adjusted the Monday morning vehicle plan, and we\u0026rsquo;ll get it fixed right up.\nThe condition of the roads is increasingly bad. But everyone says that this rainy season wasn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as last one because we have had lots of small storms with lots of sun in between instead of days and days of slow rain. It turns out what\u0026rsquo;s needed to maintain an African dirt road is not machinery or rocks, but sun. As long as the roads get enough sunlight to cook them back into hard clay from mud, everything pretty much repairs itself. The villagers have a system set up where each village is responsible for cutting the bush away from the road to ensure it gets enough light. No amount of sun fixes bridges, however. This week we had two trips interrupted by broken bridges. At one of the bridges, our driver worked most of the day to get a commercial truck off the broken bridge using his MSF vehicle and it\u0026rsquo;s tools. Then he took the mobile clinic team back to base to spend the night. The next day they made it to the mobile clinic site beyond the place they were stuck the first day. People understand here if you miss an appointment out in the bush. Sometimes you just can\u0026rsquo;t get through.\nWith the arrival of a new expat, Desma from Kenya, we got a delivery of mail from home. I got some stuff from my mom and some mix CD\u0026rsquo;s from a friend in Rome. Thanks Kristin! Kenneth and Dima, who were the log and nurse here before Lilian and I got here sent a care package for the team too. It includes the Rough Guide to West Africa, so I will start reading up on Ghana and plan my vacation which is coming up in a month. The guidebook includes no info at all on Liberia and Ivory Coast because they were at war when it was published. But it\u0026rsquo;s OK, we already know the best bars in Saclepea!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/09/03/learning-the-lingo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello from the middle of a huge rainstorm.

As we were on the ocean in Monrovia, we got nice breezes, and the temperature was quite mild. But still it was the kind of heat and humidity that makes you sweaty just five minutes after a shower.\nThe drive inland to Nimba County doesn\u0026rsquo;t really climb much, but for some reason the temperatures here are much milder. The humidity is still quite high, and when you are standing in full sun, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to remember that we are at only 9 degrees latitude. The sun rises high in the sky, and burns with a fierce intensity. Exercise between 10 AM and 4 PM is really not a good idea. Laborers who find themselves working a full day often have sweat running off them. Still, Liberians take only an hour lunch and don\u0026rsquo;t have any real rest time in the heat of the day like Spanish cultures do. My quiet time at lunch is from noon to 2 PM, and I try to make some time to lay down and read a bit, not so much to take a siesta but to force myself to take a break and stop running around. Some days I manage to fit in the break, some days not.\nAnother interesting thing about living in the tropics is that human skin is apparently evolved to live here. My skin is always soft here, and I never have problems with chapped hands or lips. Ladies, if you want to find the smoothest hands and the softest lips, come to Nimba (but don\u0026rsquo;t expect a shower when you get here).\nOne of the real drawbacks about living in the tropics is that the length of the days is almost always the same: 12 hours of light, and 12 hours of dark, sunrise and sunset are at 6. Savoring the long summer nights is one of those temperate zone pleasures that I missed out on this year, as I was already on my way to Liberia just a week after the summer solstice. The equal length days and nights have implications for security rules: sunset is always at 6 PM, so curfews related to sundown are never really shorter or longer. On the plus side, Liberians who live without electricity (that\u0026rsquo;s all of them) never have long winter nights to live through.\nToday we\u0026rsquo;ve had constant slow rain with a few hours of sun in the middle of the day. Also several times this evening we have had really intense rain, the kind that makes the metal roof roar and makes conversation impossible. All you can do is walk to the door and look at the rain. It\u0026rsquo;s a favorite pastime here, during these short blasts of mega-rain.\nDuring the sunny patch today I went out to the garden and weeded a bit. Our zucchini are already incredibly big after only a few weeks in the ground. We\u0026rsquo;re going to be one of those annoying neighbors who always comes over with too much zucchini.\nI made a new bed for more seeds. The soil is sandy and rocky, so I decided to go out in search of the soil rich in vegetable matter to round out the soil composition. I walked downhill, figuring that down by the swamp stuff would be rotting and making good soil. I ended up out in the swamp on a new walkway a family is making down there to make a rice paddy. I dug into the swamp bottom and pulled up this stinky, nasty black mud. I brought back a wheelbarrow full of it, and mixed it into my garden. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s helpful. I planted mint, lettuce, sunflowers and some other bright cheery flowers Mom sent with me. Next, I went outside the compound carrying a cutlass, and the guard hurried after me, assuming I was going to chop my leg off with it. I was looking for a few sticks to make a little shelter over my freshly planted seeds because I knew the rains would come back with a vengeance. The guard wanted to cut the sticks for me, but I firmly (and somewhat politely, though not really politely enough) told him that working in the garden on Sundays is my relaxation time and that I would cut my own damn sticks. He discreetly disappeared after that and a few minutes later I came back in the compound beaming and showed him my two sticks with forks in them, and my one long one to go across them. I put my forking sticks on each end of my new bed, and then put the long one across them as a ridge pole. Finally I leaned palm branches up along the top pole to give the seeds some shelter from the rain. Later, when the rain got really crazy, I ran out with a piece of plastic sheeting to give them more protection.\nWhile I was putting away the tools, I noticed a piece of split bamboo that would make a great gutter. I decided to put a gutter up over the door to the office. Luckily it started raining just as I started the project, so I got a chance to see it working. But the problem is that the rain comes off the corrugated iron roof at a different speed depending on the intensity of the rain. Which means that sometimes it overshoots and sometimes it undershoots the gutter. I have not really ever seen a satisfying low tech solution to this problem in the developing world, except the obvious one, which is to NOT USE GUTTERS. Next Sunday I will putter around and solve this once and for all. The current plan is to arrange for there to be something for the water rushing down the roof to hit and then drop into the gutter. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nThe work week went by in a flash. I recall that I spent a whole lot of time using Microsoft Excel to plan both the food procurement for the hospital for the next 6 weeks, and the budget for a health post renovation that we are starting in a few days. I have my head around the food problem sufficiently now that I would be very surprised if we ran out again. However, there are a lot of things about this job that are very surprising, so we\u0026rsquo;ll just have to see about that.\nThe budget for the renovation is over by a factor of 2, which is a bit of a problem. It\u0026rsquo;s not really my fault, and no one is too mad at me for sending in a budget for USD 12000 for a project that is supposed to cost USD 6000. It seems like maybe the original budget was for a building that was much smaller. In any case, I know that we can come in under the current budget, but people are still uncomfortable with it, and want me to cut it. Cutting budgets is always a pain in the ass, because you get (un-)helpful suggestions like \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t we use the extra nails from that other project?\u0026rdquo; that are hundred dollar decisions, not the thousand dollar decisions we need to be talking about to actually make a useful change to the budget. The donors don\u0026rsquo;t care if it costs USD 12100 or USD 12000. They want it to cost USD 6000, and no amount of cleverness related to the nails is going to get it there.\nThe other excitement this week was getting two suspected Lassa Fever cases. It is endemic to West Africa, and the health staff here are trained and prepared to handle it. But as a Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, you have to treat it with the same respect as things like Ebola and Marburg. Lassa Fever is spread two ways, by rodents and by contact with patients. That means that health care providers like us have to be really careful about how we handle the cases. The first one didn\u0026rsquo;t go to isolation for a while, because it is easy to miss Lassa Fever when the patient first arrives. We use virtually no laboratory tests here, since they are too expensive and difficult to do in the field. We have to send Lassa Fever suspect samples to Germany, where a biosafety level 4 laboratory does the screening. It takes a month to get the answer. By then, the patient has either been in the ground about 3 weeks, or has gotten better. So lab tests are not really useful out here on the edge of the medical system. When a suspected Lassa Fever patient dies, we have to bury them ourselves despite the wishes of the family. The negotiations around custody of the body get tense, but luckily that is not my department. Watsan (water and sanitation) is my department, so my guys have to quickly organize the decontamination of the body and arrange for the burial. It took us two days to finish this week, which was at least one day too many. I had a meeting about it and expressed my displeasure. We issued the grave diggers some more tools, so if the next one is a circus again, this time it will be time to give people a good talking to. With me, the first one is free, and you are allowed to ask for something that will help you do your job better. The second time, you catch hell.\nThose who know me well are probably snickering right now, trying to imagine me putting on a stern administrative voice to deliver a lecture. I actually always feel like a bit of an impostor doing it.\nThe final bit of excitement this week revolves around three dead sheep. On Thursday, Jerome returned from the field with the surprising news that his driver had accidentally killed three pregnant sheep that morning. He explained that they were going quite slow, and came around a corner. They saw a flock of sheep to the left, which they were about to pass. Then another sheep came bounding out of the bush into the road. The rest of the flock followed and what might have been one close call with one sheep turned into a massacre, with three twitching sheep on the road behind the Land Cruiser. Jerome and the driver immediately stopped to see what they could do for the sheep. Jerome claims he even had the medical emergency kit in the Land Cruiser open, though I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what he was planning to do with it; we don\u0026rsquo;t stock sheep-sized airways. When it was clear that three of the sheep had died, Jerome and the driver got back in the vehicle and stopped at the next village in a few hundred meters. Jerome met with some elders and assured them that MSF always pays for livestock we kill (which was technically a baldfaced lie, since we\u0026rsquo;ve never killed any livestock before in Nimba). They told him that a sheep normally costs USD 50 in the marketplace. He assured them that while he didn\u0026rsquo;t have any money, he would send someone with money the next day.\nHave I mentioned yet that being the financial administrator has certain downsides?\nI heard once someplace that if you don\u0026rsquo;t do something weekly that scares you, you are not living your life right. Last week I was apparently living life to the fullest. I showed up in the village and asked for the chief. He showed me in to the palava, which is a thatched hut with open walls. It had benches all around the sides, and a table in front. I managed the trick of not getting assigned the chief\u0026rsquo;s seat this time, which is an improvement over the last time I ended up in a village meeting. I sat next to the chief and waited while various other elders appeared and settled into the benches. All told there were probably 15 elders there, plus a dozen or so other hangers on. I explained that MSF was sorry for the accident. Next, I explained that MSF wanted to compensate the owners of the sheep, and told them that because we had allowed the owners to keep the meat from the sheep, we would like to pay USD 40 for each sheep.\nWell, that went over like a lead balloon, and I was afraid they would start throwing rotting papaya at me. A chorus of voices rose and eventually the chief quieted them, then told me the sheep were pregnant, and were about to have their babies, so that each sheep was really worth USD 100 or 150. I\u0026rsquo;d taken USD 200 with me (and had authorization from my boss to spend it all if I had to) so was ready to raise our offer. I decided to tell a little white lie in order to save face, and said, \u0026ldquo;Well, I had no idea the sheep were pregnant, and in that case, clearly we have to pay more. MSF will pay USD 150 for all three sheep.\u0026rdquo; This used two tricks I learned in Senegal. The first is that if you simply bump your offer because the other guy is too high, then he will expect you to do it again and again, meeting you in the middle. It\u0026rsquo;s a sure way to pay too much. But if you can reframe the negotiation with some new piece of info you can keep from signaling quite so baldly that you are willing to get into the \u0026ldquo;meet in the middle\u0026rdquo; thing. Also, you can make your increment sound higher by multiplying it out. I said USD 40 first, then next said USD 150 for three sheep. Which of those is a better deal? How much better is the second deal? OK, easy: USD 10 per sheep. But how long did you have to think to know it? And how much have your emotions swung in my favor during those extra few moments you were considering how much extra you just made off of me? Finally, I used the salesman\u0026rsquo;s trick of assuming the close: you don\u0026rsquo;t ask \u0026ldquo;is this price good?\u0026rdquo;, you tell them the price, and ask who to make the check to in the same breath.\nThen I discovered I\u0026rsquo;d made a tactical error when taking out the money from the safe. I\u0026rsquo;d taken fifties and some twenties to be able to pay the USD 120 I was hoping to pay. But I was not able to pay USD 150 without getting change. And getting change, while it is rarely the huge problem in Liberia that it was in Senegal, is a real problem out in a village in the bush. My driver took off with the twenty and a man from the village in search of change. I was left to make small talk with a entire palava of elders. I decided to do a little MSF education and tried to talk with them about the importance of bringing caretakers to the hospital. But this backfired when they said, \u0026ldquo;Ok, but how do our caretakers and their patients get to the hospital, your vehicles never stop, and we don\u0026rsquo;t know the phone number to call your ambulance anyway\u0026rdquo;. They don\u0026rsquo;t know the number because there is no ambulance service. We carry patients once we have accepted them as our own, because they have presented themselves at one of our clinics. I explained that they have to get themselves to Saclepea somehow, and then if they need to go to Ganta or Monrovia for treatment, MSF will carry them. Then they asked why they can\u0026rsquo;t have a clinic right there in their town. I danced around this one a while. Luckily someone interrupted and brought the topic back to MSF vehicles and asked why sometimes we did pick up people from their village. The answer is that when we see someone who we are confident will be admitted as a patient, and we are already going that direction, then we take them in the vehicle. We do this because their status has changed from \u0026ldquo;a random Liberian who wants a free ride\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;a patient\u0026rdquo;. And patients come first. I even saw a case where we left a construction worker behind in Lepula because he got bumped by another construction worker who was visibly sick and was thus a patient. (Ever seen a black person who was visibly pale? It is not a pretty picture. This guy had malaria so bad it was a wonder he was even standing.)\nAfter a while my driver returned with a new plan. One of the villagers would ride in with us to Saclepea because he had business there tonight. We\u0026rsquo;d change the twenty to two tens and send one home with him. This guy was lucky, because he was getting a LRD 300 ride to Saclepea for free, and we were happy because he solved our change problem. I had the chief sign the receipt, and off we went back home, having saved MSF\u0026rsquo;s image in the little village of Loyee.\nLater the head driver asked me how much of the USD 150 the driver who killed the sheep had to pay. This was serious business, because USD 150 is a little over half a month\u0026rsquo;s wages. I was pleased to tell him that we knew our drivers were careful because this had never happened before, and that MSF\u0026rsquo;s administration understood that paying for dead animals once every couple years was simply a cost of operating a vehicle. He was visibly relieved that his guy wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to have to pay for the sheep, and it made me feel good to know that Susan and I made the right call. Not only did we leave the village elders with a good feeling about MSF, but we left the drivers knowing that we trust them, stand behind them, and won\u0026rsquo;t leave them hung out to dry when something happens that is not their fault.\nMy uber-boss from Geneva is here this week, and I asked her for advice on how to put the dead sheep money into the accounting system. She considered it seriously for a moment and then said that I could choose between \u0026ldquo;vehicle operating costs\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;MSF identification and community relations\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of splitting it between the two, just because I\u0026rsquo;m now such an accounting whiz I know about stuff like splitting vouchers across accounts. Right now, my little sister, who is a REAL accountant, is probably rolling her eyes about how clueless her big brother is about all this sheep killing business.\nStay tuned next week for an update on the hammock being made by the leprosy patients in Ganta. I know it sounds like some sick medical joke, but I swear it\u0026rsquo;s true: people with lots of missing fingers are making us a new hammock, and the expat team is really excited about testing it out!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/08/13/a-rainy-sunday/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned the weather here much yet, but today weather dominated my activities, so I have it on the mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first got to Monrovia a month and a half ago, I was welcomed back to the tropics by the heat and humidity I had become used to in the Peten, in northeastern Guatemala.

But rules were meant to be broken.\nOur compound has: one dog, one cat, one hen with three Guinea fowl chicks as big as it, another hen with 9 chicks, 2 roosters (well, on Saturday we had two, read on to find out their fate), and two goats (like the roosters, this statistic is now out of date). In case someone from headquarters in Geneva is reading this, I would hasten to add that these are not pets but \u0026ldquo;program resources for maintenance of employee morale\u0026rdquo;. Are the bean-counters gone yet? OK, I can tell you about all our pets then\u0026hellip;\nThe hands down favorite of all the pets is Quiplu the dog. Quiplu means \u0026ldquo;civilized white person\u0026rdquo; in Mano, the local language. As in the rest of Africa, when any child sees you they shout \u0026ldquo;white man\u0026rdquo; in their language at the top of their lungs. Here, that means we hear \u0026ldquo;quiplu\u0026rdquo; a lot. I make self deprecating jokes about quiplus with my staff, and they seem to like it a lot. Our dog, like virtually every other dog in the developing world, is yellow with a white belly. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the story about why he\u0026rsquo;s our dog; this is one of the mysteries that comes about from having expats change every 6 months (I also have no idea where the spare keys are to the store rooms, but when we lose those keys, we\u0026rsquo;ll just hack off the padlocks and replace them. They are imported from China at 20 cents a piece and resold in the local market for 1 dollar). Quiplu owns the territory inside our compound, and some of the road outside. He gets a little less bold when I try to take him on walks to the city, where there are other dogs. He spends most nights with the watchmen, and twice has barked fiercely at me in the night before he realized that I live here with him. Then he sort of tries to make it up to me by coming over to get petted. He was introduced to me as \u0026ldquo;the best dog in the world\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much true. He\u0026rsquo;s totally cool with the frequent coming and goings of quiplu in his domain. His favorite place to hang out in the heat of the day is in the interior concrete hallway, which stays cool. He can often be found begging in the kitchen. Though I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen her doing it, I assume this is his favorite begging location because the cook probably gives in to his wile from time to time. Quiplu is a bit of a man of mystery, though. He can crawl under the fence anytime he feels like it, so sometimes he\u0026rsquo;s gone for a few days. We assume he is making the rounds visiting his girlfriends and making more little Quiplus. We haven\u0026rsquo;t noticed any of the condoms from the condom basket getting used, so perhaps we need to have a talk with Quiplu about safe sex.\nI was actually a cat person before a certain dog won my heart earlier this year. So it pains me to admit this, but Dude the cat is hands down the worst cat in the world. Well, he\u0026rsquo;s not violent or destructive, but he\u0026rsquo;s got this really annoying meow, and he insists on begging when he\u0026rsquo;s not wanted. He is also lazy as hell: we have never seen him so much as twitch his tail when he sees a nice juicy cockroach or moth. This place ought to be a wonderland for a cat, with big crunchy things and plenty of things that scurry of the warm- and cold-blooded variety. But Dude just sits and begs, unsuccessfully. In addition to his vocal talents to annoy, he is gross. He was bitten by a snake a while ago and developed these sores on each side of his mouth. Being compassionate medical people, MSFers have apparently tried everything (including heisting antibiotics from the expat pharmacy box) to try to clear up the sores, but nothing works. We\u0026rsquo;ve given up and assume they are the mark of the devil.\nThe story about the Guinea fowl is interesting. Someone, I guess a watchman, brought 6 Guinea fowl eggs to our compound and put them under our hen after she laid some chicken eggs. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know about the switch and while we were eating freshly laid chicken eggs for breakfast, she was incubating Guinea fowl. At first, it was no big deal. But after about a month, she\u0026rsquo;s beginning to catch on that there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong with her chicks. They have grown up to be bigger and faster than her. So now, when she\u0026rsquo;s lucky, they just run ahead of her getting all the good bugs and worms and stuff. When they are feeling nasty, they fly up to her and chase her down. We really feel bad for her. At least there are only 3 now, as the person who brought the eggs split them with us. A few weeks ago they took their three fowl, and left our three as payment for using our chicken and our yard to feed them. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to serve the three Guinea fowl for Thanksgiving, which we\u0026rsquo;ll hold on November 1st in honor of our field coordinator, a Canadian.\nThe two roosters and two goats came home from Lepula this weekend. Jerome and I attended the opening ceremony for the health post. As a thank you for the big new health post, MSF was given these animals. We brought them home and had to decide what to do with them. We knew the roosters were dead meat; the team had a rooster a while ago and it was too annoying to have in the compound due to noise, bullying the cat, etc. The goats required more finesse. We also know that having a goat in the compound is not a good idea. For a long time MSF had a goat named Norman. It eventually got donated to an orphanage when it started climbing onto the dinner table. Goats also make a lot of noise, which is annoying. So we knew the goats had to go. But two goats is a lot of meat. The goats were also quite small, really just big kids. Showing my typical quiplu farm knowledge, I told the cook I wanted to find someplace else to let the goats grow up, and pay the person to hold the goats. She laughed and said that we could eat them now. But our freezer is only about one goat big\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s a capacity measurement written in the manual in litres, but as I am now not only a logistician but a goat farmer, I prefer to think about freezer capacity in the units of milliGoats, and our freezer is only 1000 milliGoats.\nSo we came up with this complicated plan to have Mary hire a guy for a half day to slaughter the goat and butcher the goat meat, then take the other goat to a friend of hers to grow up a little. We slaughtered the big goat (which was named Jerome) on Monday and enjoyed incredible roast goat pieces that night. We have the rest of Jerome in the freezer for later. The other goat, who is named Jeff, was supposed to go to the deluxe goat ranch in the next town (i.e. be tied up next to the garbage pile behind a hut). But somehow it\u0026rsquo;s now the second night that Jeff the goat is here, and my team members are making dark comments about \u0026ldquo;slaughtering Jeff\u0026rdquo;, so I think that I should look into why the goat is still here tomorrow, if not to save his hide, to save mine.\nOn Saturday, we got help from one of the watchmen to slaughter, pluck, and butcher one of our roosters. We have to cook for ourselves on Sunday, so I had bragged to my teammates about how they ought to let the American cook them Southern-style fried chicken. Jerome got excited about the prospect of adding \u0026ldquo;slaughtered a chicken\u0026rdquo; to his resume and got involved, though somehow he was absent for most of the plucking and all of the butchering. Jerome\u0026rsquo;s more into the bloody part; he\u0026rsquo;s not so much into cooking. The watchman taught me how to pluck the bird. Liberians often don\u0026rsquo;t give instructions in complete form, instead they tell you one step and then look frustrated and confused when you get the second step wrong (which they haven\u0026rsquo;t told you all the way yet). This led to a lot of confusion and laughing, as I was trying to pluck the chicken the Liberian way, but basically was just the punch line in all the jokes about the clueless quiplu. To be fair, I did understand the concept (dunk it in boiling water), I just didn\u0026rsquo;t understand how to implement it gracefully with the stuff we had on hand. Now I know that you pour the water into the bucket with the chicken, which lets the chicken get covered, then you pour the chicken and the water into the big washtub to do the actual plucking.\nMaking the fried chicken was easy, after all I saw it once on Good Eats and figured I probably remembered enough from seeing my Mom do it a few times. At home, I cook only vegetarian food (and, to be crystal clear: I also do not normally slaughter chickens) so frying chicken was a first for me. I put ground chili pepper into the flour, and lots of salt and pepper. It\u0026rsquo;s a good thing that I lavished plenty of effort on the crispy part because as soon as my teammates and I bit into the chicken we figured out why Liberians stew their chicken instead of frying it: Liberian roosters are the toughest meat you can imagine. Everyone agreed that the crispy coating on the skin was yummy, but the fried chicken itself was a bit of a disaster. Now I know why the American poultry industry is so far removed from farm-raised food\u0026hellip; because farm raised food sucks. As a thank you for putting up with my clueless attempts to pluck the rooster, I gave the watchman the other rooster. OK, so I also gave it to him because the first one was so terrible I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to even try to cook the second one.\nSo, now you know the rest of the lyrics to \u0026ldquo;MSFers had a farm, E I E I O.

The threat of unrest on a national holiday meant that we were confined to the compound all day while the staff had the day off. Even though I had a day off to catch up, I had a really hectic morning with a thousand little problems to solve. The most embarrassing one is that we ran out of rice for the hospital. Last week we ran out of tea, which was a big crisis because the staff is so touchy about missing a tea break. Running out of rice and tea were basically both squarely my fault, but each time they were easy to fix, and I\u0026rsquo;m confident that we\u0026rsquo;ve got things set up right for August.\nI got to meet the log from MSF Holland, Taj. He works in Sanniquille. He\u0026rsquo;s a really nice American guy from Seattle. He is halfway through his 9 month contract and really has the hang of working here. He invited me to come visit anytime, which I will be happy to do. The MSF sections in Liberia are really friendly, which is nice. Taj and I were grousing about not being able to find any girlfriends since we are not allowed to date Liberian women. Jerome and I have only Susan (the boss) and Lilian, who is married, to choose from (Emir, the remaining man, is married also). Taj said at Sanniquille, it is two guys about 30 and four 50 year old women. Which to me didn\u0026rsquo;t sound too bad, but he\u0026rsquo;s apparently not interested. I think I need to make a trip to Sanniquille!\nAlso a few days ago the newest member of the team arrived. Lilian is a nurse from the German speaking part of Switzerland. I haven\u0026rsquo;t learned about her background yet. She\u0026rsquo;s very different than Dima, but she will be a good member of the team, and the family. She is really down to earth and didn\u0026rsquo;t flinch at all when I showed her our bucket-flushed toilet and the shower which the cockroaches reluctantly let us share with them\u0026hellip; they don\u0026rsquo;t even run when we turn the lights on anymore! I think it is time for a bottle of SpriGone, an insecticide from Dubai which Liberians use like air freshener. In fact, today I used some SpriGone on a termite nest out where I was installing the satellite phone antenna and I realized it was the same nice scent I\u0026rsquo;d noticed in my room each day after the house cleaner finishes tidying up. And all this time I thought it was just the fresh sheets she puts on every day. Actually, she has been helpfully spraying insecticide all around our rooms!\nIt is my after-lunch break, and I think I will go lay down and play with the shortwave radio I bought for USD 12 last week. It was supposed to cost 10, but I got them down from 15 to 12. It would have been better to send an African to buy it for me, but it was fun anyway and 2 dollars is not the end of the world. The traders in electronics are all Guineans who speak French, so we did the old calculator negotiation thing, then in the end the batteries he had were damaged, so I made him give me some LRD to go buy some batteries of my own. Jerome and I brought back a big bamboo pole from the bush and I put up an antenna, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it\u0026rsquo;s really better than the built-in one. I think it just picks up more noise. The national staff were all laughing as I walked around base with my big bamboo pole. They think it is hysterical when a white man tries to do any work with our hands. Leading by doing is difficult here because people just scramble to arrange for it to be impossible for you to exert yourself. If you are persistent and make it clear you\u0026rsquo;re going to get your hands dirty and work too, then they respect it, but their first assumption is that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing anything, like how a porter acts in a hotel.\nTomorrow we have a big workshop at the hospital to teach the national staff about the MSF movement they are part of. For many of them, it is difficult to grasp the worldwide significance of the movement, and what their place is in it. Liberians have a solid understanding of NGO\u0026rsquo;s, but it is somewhat colored by the type of NGO\u0026rsquo;s that dominate the economy here. The vast majority of their budgets come from governments, which makes them less frugal than us. We also have some staff who consider this just a job, and look at us like we are from Mars when we explain about concepts like duty, impartiality, witnessing, and so on. (Witnessing has a technical definition in the MSF world which is light years away from the Christian use of the word. Perhaps I will try to explain a little bit in another posting.) All of the expats have to attend the workshop, so my day will be somewhat less hectic tomorrow, at least once the meeting starts. Of course, the log is also the all purpose events planner, so I had some minor crises to work out today related to the event, and will be running around like a wedding planner (but with a VHF radio in my belt and riding in a Land Cruiser instead of a Camry).\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/07/27/what-we-do-on-a-holiday/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI got lots of stuff done on my \u0026ldquo;day off\u0026rdquo; yesterday due to the Liberian Independence Day. The threat of unrest on a national holiday meant that we were confined to the compound all day while the staff had the day off. Even though I had a day off to catch up, I had a really hectic morning with a thousand little problems to solve. The most embarrassing one is that we ran out of rice for the hospital. Last week we ran out of tea, which was a big crisis because the staff is so touchy about missing a tea break. Running out of rice and tea were basically both squarely my fault, but each time they were easy to fix, and I\u0026rsquo;m confident that we\u0026rsquo;ve got things set up right for August.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What we do on a holiday"},{"content":"I sat down to do my Sunday blog posting at about 10 pm but was immediately interrupted by our night watchman. He came to me to tell me that the hospital staff had an UNMIL (UN Mission in Liberia) vehicle there asking MSF staff to go with them out into the night to fetch an injured patient from the site of a motorcycle accident halfway to Tappita. I knew we probably couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it, because it breaks several rules (staff don\u0026rsquo;t leave the hospital to treat patients, we don\u0026rsquo;t travel at night, and we don\u0026rsquo;t ride in UNMIL vehicles), but I went and got a second opinion from the field coordinator, who is the most senior person on site. She agreed, so I had to give the hospital alternative instructions: give UNMIL dressings for one patient and instructions on how to stabilize them and transport them. I also got the guards on the radio and reminded them of their responsibilities with respect to UNMIL, which is that their vehicles must stay outside the hospital gates, no matter how insistent the driver or how urgent the situation seems. MSF staff may go out and carry in any patient that UNMIL drops off (no questions asked; it could be a soldier, as long as he\u0026rsquo;s unarmed). The watchmen know the drill, but emergencies get people excited, and sometimes people forget rules. I figured it was better for the voice of reason to remind them of the rules than to have someone make a bad decision and then have people talking tomorrow about how the new log lets UNMIL come in the hospital.\nI posted one of our watchmen in the radio room to relay messages, since sometimes I can\u0026rsquo;t hear messages from the hospital in my room. I will stay up tonight to make sure things go smoothly. I\u0026rsquo;m really hoping that in an hour or so I hear that the patient arrived in stable condition\u0026hellip; it will really suck if the patient dies and it was our security restrictions that prevented us from sending help. Note, \u0026ldquo;really suck\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it isn\u0026rsquo;t the right decision. Sometimes the right decision just really sucks. Let\u0026rsquo;s cross our fingers for the patient and hope UNMIL has someone trained in first aid on scene.\nUpdate: At least one patient arrived in stable condition, with multiple open fractures of the tibia and fibula. He\u0026rsquo;s on pain killers for the night and we will decide what to do with him in the morning\u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;s probably going on the truck to Monrovia, which was going anyway. There was no radio chatter about the second patient, hopefully that means the hospital staff were able to take care of him without the help of the expats.\nThe other big drama is a planned series of tasks next week to prepare better for evacuation. The threats to our project, however slight, have changed direction 180 degrees, so we have to redo the evacuation plan. Furthermore, we have been lax, so we are taking the occasion of the Liberian Independence Day next Wednesday to force ourselves to make and practice a better plan for evacuating. We will be on an increased security level next week, though in some ways even that is an exercise. The threat (rumors of an attack on Ganta) are just not credible, but there is a possibility that the rumors themselves could cause unrest.\nDrama like this is rare. Usually the drama is restricted to firing people, or having their hours computed wrong or forgetting to take new contracts with me into the bush to have them signed. This is the administrative part of my job that takes up 70% of my time, and provides 90% of the frustrations. But even so, I manage to avoid the really annoying stuff and take up the fun stuff. Tonight, Susan and I counted the month\u0026rsquo;s salaries into 150 envelopes. The system we use was supposed to be foolproof, but we ended up off by a few hundred dollars at the end. The key when things like this happen is to stay calm and be methodical about tracking the error. I use lots of the systems I learned for tracking bugs in computer programs: keep records of what you are doing and why, set up experiments whose answer you know as a canary in the coal mine to catch errors early, and beware that two or more bugs (accounting errors) can compound to hide each other. Tonight there were three errors: I\u0026rsquo;d paid a salary early and not accounted for it because I was in a hurry. Second, Susan and I put five 10 dollar bills into the wrong place. Finally, I put one too many one hundred dollar bills into an envelope. The last one was the hardest to find, but by the time we found the first two errors, I was almost 100% certain the last error was an extra hundred dollar bill. The problem is that when you discover the error, you see the combined effect of the three (minus 243, plus 50, minus 100: thus minus 293) not the three actual errors.\nSusan just rolled her eyes when I tried to explain that 10 years of tracking software bugs prepared me for accounting. But I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that it\u0026rsquo;s all the same skills, just with hundred dollar bills, Land Cruisers, radios, UNMIL, and really big bugs (the other kind: insects).\nSpeaking of radios, I also set up a fun experiment today (Sunday has turned into \u0026ldquo;fix the radio\u0026rdquo; day, which I consider a fun enough job to do on my day off). The HF radio in Turtle 4 is failing to tune, which means that the big fancy antenna is inefficient and the 35 watt radio might as well be a 2 watt one. (Long ago, I suspect T4 stood for Truck 4, but we call them Turtles now.) It is a royal pain in the ass to change the tuner out on these radios because they are externally mounted, as part of the antenna assembly. The tuner is the big black pedestal that the antenna is sitting up on. It is usually in front of the passenger, on the front bumper. I asked the driver to park a Land Cruiser with a working tuner (T13) within inches of T4\u0026rsquo;s tuner. I then used the slack in the antenna cable to plug T4\u0026rsquo;s radio into T13\u0026rsquo;s tuner and antenna. T4\u0026rsquo;s radio immediately tuned right up, so I knew that T4\u0026rsquo;s tuner is broken. I pointed to the two cars joined by the fragile antenna cable and told the driver not to move either truck\u0026hellip; he laughed and understood the consequences\u0026hellip; if we were lucky it would only destroy the good tuner and not also rip the good radio out of the truck! We disentangled the mating turtles and sent them back to their parking spots. Tomorrow I will order a replacement tuner. Because one in three cars in Monrovia is a UN or other NGO vehicle with an HF radio on it, and we all use Codan radios, it will be easy to find spare parts. The funny thing is in the US it would probably take 6 weeks to get a replacement, since they are made in Australia. But in Monrovia, the Codan guy will just ride over in a taxi and drop the thing off, probably taking cash payment for it.\nOne thing they tell you over and over again in Logistician School is that stepping down out of a Land Cruiser to a crowd of cheering children makes you feel like a god and that you should be careful to not act like an ass as a result of being treated like a god all the time. It\u0026rsquo;s all true. You get treated like a god, and as an experienced logistician told me, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s not really anything out in the bush other than your own conscience to keep you from going off the rails. And there are a lot of temptations.\u0026rdquo; What they DO NOT tell you in Logistician School is that Land Cruisers are quite possibly the most uncomfortable way to ride, topping even Chicken Buses for sheer unpleasantness. There is too little leg room, so your knee is always against the window crank. If you put up the window a bit to move the crank a few degrees, you now have a narrow piece of glass poking the underside of your arm (which you are jauntily hanging out the window, like the god you are). The seats are nothing to write home about, and they don\u0026rsquo;t even have faded graffiti from American junior high schoolers to read, like the Chicken Buses do. We often plan things efficiently enough that the vehicle is loaded full, which means that two expats are crammed in the front seat next to the driver, and the back is full of patients and caretakers with a significantly different cultural understanding of hygiene than those of us from Europe and North America.\nI paid a salary early this week because one of my drivers came to me looking pale and sick as a dog. An employee comes to me several times a week looking like this, and usually it is malaria, which means drugs from MSF and three days rest. Before I could ask him what was wrong he explained that he is bereaved. His 16 year old son died that night. In the days before, MSF had referred him to Ganta, and Ganta had in turn referred him to Phebe. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the son died of, but it is fairly rare to have 16 year olds die except from accidents (or wars, which are mercifully not happening right now in West Africa). Pregnant women, children under five, and people over 40 are the majority of our fatalities, not 16 year old men. It is a terrible tragedy for his family and my heart went out to him. Luckily, MSF\u0026rsquo;s policies in this case are quite humane. He gets 7 days off, and because payday would fall during his family leave, I decided on the spot to send him out of the office with not only his family leave approved, but his month\u0026rsquo;s pay too. It\u0026rsquo;s a shallow gesture to send someone out the door with USD 243, but in a society where pretty much everyone lives paycheck to paycheck (and there are no banks, and so, come to think of it, no paychecks), even getting paid three days early is a significant help.\nSo, there\u0026rsquo;s some positive things to getting to be a god. When you are the god of money, you sometimes get to do the right thing.\nThe key to this job is making sure that once every week (preferably several times a week) you notice something and think, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got the best job on the planet.\u0026rdquo; This week\u0026rsquo;s moments included sunrise over the jungle, performing in the quiplu comedy hour at the market as I tried to buy ingredients for cassava leaf soup, and scaring a bunch of kids half to death by jumping at them, then doing high fives all around when they realized the stories they have been told about quiplus eating babies are all bullshit and that white guys just like to clown around like 5 year olds.\nIn case I haven\u0026rsquo;t done a good enough job of recruiting, consider this\u0026hellip; MSF is currently redoing their salary structure, and many experienced professionals are finding that their existing work experience plus their MSF experience (after their first mission) is resulting in pay that rivals \u0026ldquo;real life\u0026rdquo;. As a first mission person, I will remain at CHF 1500 a month (about USD 1200). All that and you get reminded several times a week that you have the best job on the planet. Go surf over to the MSF \u0026ldquo;putting your principles into practice\u0026rdquo; web page to find out how to come out and see me so we can scare some more African kids to death then do high fives all around.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/07/23/a-little-excitement/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI sat down to do my Sunday blog posting at about 10 pm but was immediately interrupted by our night watchman.

The glib answer is that we do everything the medical team either cannot or do not want to do. But actually in this project, at this time, it is a combination of upper management (meetings and signatures on slips of paper) and construction planning and management.\nI get up each work day at 6:45 am. I spend 15 minutes or so getting awake, and then I meet my assistant and chat about how the day is going to go. The drivers are arriving at 7 am and getting their vehicles ready. Sometimes they arrive late, so they are put away dirty, so there are people washing cars, checking oil and other fluids, etc. The stock keeper, who is responsible for the fuel store, is fueling vehicles. Once I have a general idea that things are going according to plan and which vehicles will be ready to work that day, I head in to share breakfast with the team.\nWe make our own tea and toast, and to keep it interesting I eat it with Nutella some days, peanut butter others. We also have this really excellent marmalade, the best I have ever had. It comes from Iran, I think. The supermarkets in Monrovia appear to be randomly stocked with shipping containers full of stuff imported from Europe, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. It\u0026rsquo;s a little disorienting trying to shop there, since beside the Kellog\u0026rsquo;s Frosted Flakes, you might find a package of dates who\u0026rsquo;s label is written entirely in Arabic script, and over in the refrigerated section, Dutch yogurt.\nThe rest of the expat and national staff team starts at 8 am. The medical staff need to be at the hospital for an 8 am meeting each morning, so that\u0026rsquo;s the first car to leave. On Tuesday mornings, there\u0026rsquo;s a flurry of packing as the mobile outreach team leaves. They stay out in the bush for four days, returning on Friday night. Sometimes during the week they will call in on the HF radio with a request to refer a patient to the hospital. Then we send a vehicle out to meet them. The vehicle carries a jerrycan of diesel to the outreach clinic to replace the diesel they used to meet us halfway with the patient. There\u0026rsquo;s no filling stations in the bush, and their budget for fuel for the week is pretty tight as it is.\nDuring the day, I work most of the time at the office, but I take trips to the refugee camp where the hospital is, and also to other sites in town. Last week I visited the cemetery where MSF buries bodies of people whose family cannot afford to transport them back to their home village. Depending on the beliefs of the family, in fact, sometimes after we inform them that a patient has expired, they simply pack up and start walking home, leaving us with the body. It was a minor shock to me the first time my colleagues started talking about a patient expiring, but I quickly realized that it\u0026rsquo;s the simple truth of life at a hospital - you don\u0026rsquo;t save them all, and when you lose a patient, there\u0026rsquo;s work to be done: taking care of the body, cleaning the room, and taking care of the next patient (hopefully with a better outcome).\nSome days I plan all-day trips to one of the outlying health posts to supervise the construction there. On a day like that we leave the base about 9 am, depending on a hundred other interruptions and competing demands for the vehicle in the morning. Once we set off, it is a 2 hour drive to Lepula. I spend a couple hours there, paying workers, reviewing progress made, taking down lists of missing materials, discussing priorities for the next week\u0026rsquo;s work, then return home (leaving no later than 4 pm, in order to avoid traveling at night). This kind of remote management has been going on at Lepula for months, and it is a pretty inefficient way of doing things. Because there is no cell phone service that far out in the bush, and no HF radio, if there is a hold up during the week, we don\u0026rsquo;t find out about it until one week later. I\u0026rsquo;m contemplating what I\u0026rsquo;m going to change to make the next health post refurbishment go a little smoother. Right now I am considering a hybrid solution, where I live there two days a week, and leave an HF radio for them the other days. The HF radio runs off a 12 volt battery that we can hopefully charge during my visits using the Land Cruiser\u0026rsquo;s alternator. It is a low power radio, and so it depends on a very good antenna. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of looking forward to rigging that up.\nIn general, construction in the bush is difficult and time consuming because not only does it take a week to find out about a missing hinge or screw, but then the nearest hardware store is a 2 hour round trip away, in Ganta (away from the bush, towards the capital\u0026hellip; a common topology in the developing world). Most sizable construction materials including plywood, zinc roofing sheets, pressed fiber board for ceilings, and rebar for concrete has to come from Monrovia. The capital staff takes my orders and arranges to send them to me via a rented truck. The truck takes several hours to load in the morning and about 10 hours to make the journey, so it invariably arrives at midnight. We let it park in the compound and then unload it in the morning. The trucks that make the trip from Monrovia are too big to go on the dirt roads into the bush, so we have to move the goods onto a smaller truck. Of course all handling is by hand, not with forklifts, which means things get beat up along the way. This is why brand new things in the developing world usually look about 10 years old by the time they are installed. And then day to day life on a refrigerator or door handle is tough. Finally, the majority of goods here are extremely low quality Chinese imports, which means that sometimes the day after you install them they are already broken.\nWhen I go to a remote construction site, I take a briefcase full of cash to pay the daily hire workers. The driver and I sit at a little table and he calls them through one by one as I count out their pay. Sometimes they say thank you to me, and it makes me feel pretty good to say \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re welcome\u0026rdquo; on behalf of MSF. It certainly makes up for the other kinds of conversations, when daily workers corner me and ask for work and I have to explain that when there is work, the construction supervisor will hire them, but today there is none. An unskilled worker makes 300 LRD, about 5 USD. A skilled worker makes about a dollar more. Unemployment here is over 70%, so people who don\u0026rsquo;t have salaried jobs really have to scramble to get enough work to support their families, which are huge for a hundred reasons I won\u0026rsquo;t go into now (but the US-backed policy of abstinence as a family planning method is certainly not very helpful).\nWhen I am working around the office it\u0026rsquo;s typical office work. I use a computer (though we all share them, moving files around on memory sticks). I do backups and anti-virus warfare on the computers. I\u0026rsquo;m asked to review and sign an endless stream of paperwork from my staff and the rest of the project as well. I print things, then sign them, then zealously stamp them with the MSF seal like the third world bureaucrat I have become. One thing\u0026rsquo;s not like a typical office: I had to literally debug a toner cartridge that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t print by pulling the remains of a big wasp out of it!\nBecause the logistics team is currently running like a well oiled machine, I am spending most of my attention devoted to logistics on questions of new construction, renovation, and maintenance. I am currently planning a new office building and an increase in bedrooms at the base. I need to schedule a visit to a health post in Zekepa to investigate some concrete work we owe them. And finally, I need to start the Diallah health post renovation, which will be my major construction task while I am here.\nI started out trying to describe a day in my life, but it\u0026rsquo;s so varied that I got lost along the way. So let me just finish with the end of the day\u0026hellip; travel restrictions cause the rest of the expat team to filter back in to base around 5 pm. It\u0026rsquo;s the end of the work day, so someone usually pops open a Club Beer (simultaneously the best, worst, cheapest, and only beer in Liberia) and we sit down to relax. Mary, our cook, puts dinner on the table, but it\u0026rsquo;s usually between 6 and 7 before we are in the mood for it. We sometimes eat together like a family, and sometimes just grab a plate one or two at a time when we feel like it. Sometimes conversation lingers, sometimes people disappear to entertain themselves with books, personal email, etc. Once in a while, a full fledged party breaks out. But it can\u0026rsquo;t go too late, because the next morning I get up at 6:45 am and do it all again\u0026hellip; until Sunday, which is our day off.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/07/16/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-log/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI figured I should give people an idea what exactly a logistician does.

At the same time, I also helped close the books for June. We had a troublesome 281 USD to track down, but thanks to my training in Geneva, which happened to cover the precise tricky bit accounting we were having trouble with, I got it fixed. Of course, the majority of the work to prepare for closing the books was done by my assistant, Mr. Toe. He brings me the books ready to go, and I review them. He tried his hardest to get them to balance, but this time it was up to me to find the remaining errors.\nFor the Liberian dollar accounts, it is almost impossible to make them balance. We just handle way too many bills, and the possibility that a stack of 100 bills will be short by one bill when we receive it is always there. To give you an idea of the problem, the exchange rate is 1 USD = 56 LRD. The bills are 20 LRD and 50 LRD, so if we were paying someone about 100 USD (5600 LRD), we could be handling as many as 280 bills. And a few of those are going to get miscounted.\nSo you can see that the administrative side of my job is dominated by shuffling papers, both currency and receipts, invoices, etc. Thankfully Mr. Toe handles much of this, and it is up to me to handle the final checks on things, as at the end of the day it my signature, not Mr. Toe\u0026rsquo;s, on the books.\nThe other half of my job is logistics, which is much more interesting and varied. This week I got a tour of the water treatment plant. Walker, my head watsan guy showed me where the raw water comes from, how it settles, and how he calculates the chlorine to add. He\u0026rsquo;s received really good training from previous expats, so he is completely self-contained. Even so, he wants more training still, and it is up to me to figure out what training resources we have and make them available to him. Walker invited other people to watch as he demonstrated for me, so it turned into a little class. It was really fascinating to see Walker do and talk about what I\u0026rsquo;d read a bunch about, both in training with RedR in London, and on my own. I was able to add some explanations for the mysterious parts of the process based on Frosh Chem, the hellish chemistry course that almost killed me during my first semester of college.\nIt is a common problem in the developing world that even when a local person masters a complex task with coaching from someone trained in the developed world, they focus on how to do it and not on why they have been trained to do it that way. That\u0026rsquo;s no problem as long as they keep doing it right, but their superficial knowledge prevents them from effectively teaching their coworkers, or adapting the knowledge if the conditions change. The leverage you hope to get by teaching supervisors and having them teach their staff is lost. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim that in my first six months working in Liberia I\u0026rsquo;ll have any chance of solving this problem that\u0026rsquo;s been afflicting Africa for 100 years, but hopefully since I\u0026rsquo;ve already seen it with my own two eyes, I can consider what to do to minimize it.\nI also took another trip to Lepula, where we are building a health post. It is almost done now, so we took the furniture for the building out from where it was built and stockpiled in Saclepea. The expat team is planning final details to get the place open. Susan, the Field Coordinator (fieldco) met with the town chief to plan an opening ceremony. Jerome put in a big order for little stuff like trash cans, mattresses, etc to fill the place up. I worked with the supervisor on how to solve a problem with a door that was made the wrong size. I also surveyed a warehouse that the community has loaned to us to hold construction materials, and agreed with their request to donate some materials to the community to fix up the warehouse as a thank you for letting us use it.\nWe moved a fair amount of freight back and forth this week. We had construction supplies coming in from Monrovia, we had to send some therapeutic food down to Benson Hospital, and we had parts of our expat food order, and monthly project order trickle in. It always makes me feel like Santa Claus to get to tell someone that their order has arrived, particularly when the order is something critical like tomatoes or canned asparagus (a real favorite of the boss). Because we have construction projects downstream from us in the supply chain, there\u0026rsquo;s some planning to be done to make sure that inbound items can be transferred to smaller trucks and sent into the bush without delay. This is the essence of supply chain management, and Roger (my logistics assistant) showed me how it\u0026rsquo;s done this week by having the little truck ready for direct trans-loading when the big truck arrived.\nThe week was also filled with various types of meetings. I interviewed a new taxi driver, met with representatives from the World Food Programme, sat in on the delivery of a warning letter to a staff member, held a meeting with a subordinate about creeping staffing levels, and attended my first expat staff meeting. Susan and I also had a nice meeting to welcome me and give me the context of the project, though I had picked it up pretty much by context by the time we had time for the meeting!\nThe other crisis we dealt with this week was due to a dead computer. Thanks to excellent IT support from Geneva I was able to fix things up using just what we had on hand here. It\u0026rsquo;s not pretty, but everyone seems happy with the new setup. Mom, thanks for the 1 gigabyte memory stick, I used it to move stuff around from the dying computer in its death throes.\nToday I started a garden. During the week I arranged for some fertile soil to be delivered, because the soil in the compound here is said to have too little sand and too much iron. I put the soil into egg cups and planted seeds to get them to germinate. Later we\u0026rsquo;ll transplant the seedlings into some beds the gardener will make for us.\nToday we are going in to town to watch the World Cup final between Italy and France. My teammate Jerome is an anyone-but-France fan, so I think I\u0026rsquo;ll go with the flow and support Italy. We watch the matches at a little bar called Farmer\u0026rsquo;s Friend. The Cokes are cold, and only 30 LRD. The beers are a fair price at 100 LRD for a 750 ml bottle (consider that for a second the next time you pay 6 USD for a pint in California). The owner of Farmer\u0026rsquo;s Friend knows it\u0026rsquo;s our favorite hangout for games, so often we arrive to find seats with signs that say, \u0026ldquo;reserved for MSF\u0026rdquo;. It is nice to be known in the city like this, but it can also be a problem. We are in a fishbowl, and everything we do is reported on the bush telegraph (the rumor mill) far and wide.\nNext week, we have a huge amount of contract printing and signing to get through due to a big contract change that\u0026rsquo;s in progress. We also have to start planning some trips to survey some upcoming construction work in the bush. Finally, the team will be adjusting to the loss of two expats, and the arrival of several others (some visiting from Monrovia, some coming to stay). Dima will be returning to Geneva on Monday (assuming I\u0026rsquo;ve got the logistics right) and Dr. Emir has just left for a 2 week vacation.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/07/09/my-first-week-in-nimba/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, I survived my first week as the log/admin for the Nimba project!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big event this week was me taking over financial responsibility for the safes and all the cash in the project. At the same time, I also helped close the books for June. We had a troublesome 281 USD to track down, but thanks to my training in Geneva, which happened to cover the precise tricky bit accounting we were having trouble with, I got it fixed. Of course, the majority of the work to prepare for closing the books was done by my assistant, Mr. Toe. He brings me the books ready to go, and I review them. He tried his hardest to get them to balance, but this time it was up to me to find the remaining errors.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My first week in Nimba"},{"content":"On Friday, Jerome and I made the drive up to Nimba County. We took 2 patients, their 2 caregivers, and a baby. In Africa, hospitals budget for two people for every admitted patient. The second person is a caregiver, who is responsible for feeding and washing the patient. This doubles the amount of logistical needs related to patients (food, transport, etc) but it dramatically reduces the per-patient workload of the skilled nursing labor, which means the few nurses the countries have go farther. But the downside is that the families are more profoundly disrupted by someone going to the hospital, since typically the wife/mother is the caregiver. That means the older children at home have to do the work their mom was doing (gathering firewood, farming, doing the laundry) which may mean they leave school temporarily. So you can see that the ripple effects go out and out when MSF decides to admit a patient.\nThough we had a slow start, the roads were in fine shape all the way to Saclepea, and we got in around 5:30 pm after about a 6 hour trip. It was really amazing to see a UNHCR refugee camp in real life after learning about them for so long. It was also interesting to see things with my own eyes that Kenneth, the previous log/admin had drawn maps of, or described from digital pictures. My first reaction to the MSF hospital at Saclepea was that it is SO BIG! There are buildings made of poles and plastic sheeting going out in every direction from the gate. We only made a quick visit to drop off the patients. I will be back on Monday to tour the place and learn about the tasks we need to do. UNHCR has asked us to move the gate to simplify movement of people, so that will probably be a high priority.\nAfter stopping at the hospital, we continued to our base, where we live and have our offices. I got to meet the remaining two members of the team. We had dinner (meat in red sauce on top of rice) and they toasted my arrival. The magazines I brought from Heathrow were welcome, none more than a celebrity gossip rag called Hello. The funny thing was it was an impulse purchase after I\u0026rsquo;d already picked out a hefty stack of magazines. Further proof of a lesson that several MSF logisticians have been teaching me: trust your instincts and you\u0026rsquo;ll do fine.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a tiny amount of management to do so far with my staff, mostly just meeting people and making broad declarations about how good Kenneth says they are, and how I\u0026rsquo;m not here to change anything, that it is important that they complete their tasks and talk to their supervisor about problems just like they always have. The same platitudes that always drove me nuts when a new boss arrived in Silicon Valley. Sigh. I did get up in the night the first night and check the night watchmen. I found 1 out of 3 asleep, which I suppose is good enough. The sleeping one knows that I know, though, and that\u0026rsquo;s the important thing. I suspect he\u0026rsquo;ll fix the problem on his own.\nOn Saturday, Susan and I went to Lepula, where MSF has been building a big shiny new health post for some time. This project is stuck in the rut of \u0026ldquo;just one more week\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s not really anyone\u0026rsquo;s fault\u0026hellip; just a matter of details not getting done. We paid the staff for last week, talked with the foreman about next week\u0026rsquo;s work, and then brought back some masons from Saclepea whose work was done. Of course, when it came time to load the 6 people, the Land Cruiser mysteriously had 8 people in it, so Susan gave me a quick lesson in crowd control. The community wanted to keep one of the young men, and a certain young lady (maybe about 15) was embarrassed, laughing, and hiding behind a friend. I have no idea what the story was, but between the community\u0026rsquo;s desire to unload one guy and some other negotiations related to a painter who needed to go to the hospital, we got the passengers loaded and off we went. The drive to Lepula is bone-jarring, and lasts about 2 hours. It\u0026rsquo;s not really too much worse than 4x4 tracks I have seen in the United States, except the design they use for their bridges leaves out a lot of the details that make them feel safer, like railings and decking that you can\u0026rsquo;t see through. MSF rehabilitated some of those bridges. Kenneth showed me before and after pictures\u0026hellip;. it was one of the times when I thought, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got to be kidding me, I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be in charge of bridge rehab too!?!\u0026rdquo;\nToday is Sunday, which we have off. This Sunday a few of us will work on a special paperwork-heavy project this afternoon related to new contracts for the staff. It\u0026rsquo;s no problem for me, since my time in Monrovia was not very intensive, but generally I am going to be very careful not to work on Sunday. I have also already decided to change something the previous log/admin did, which was to keep his radio on at night. I\u0026rsquo;ve instructed the guards to come get me for help any time, but not to expect me to listen to the radio. (I think I\u0026rsquo;ll probably keep one in my room anyway, but turned off.)\nI\u0026rsquo;m really happy I\u0026rsquo;ve achieved my goal and gotten myself here. Day by day, I learn things and react to things in ways that make me think this mission will probably go OK, but I still worry that this first MSF mission will be like Harvey Mudd College was: much harder to get OUT of successfully than to get into!\nFinally, I owe a HUGE thank you to everyone in my family (and Karl!) that helped find Kat a new home. During the last few days before I left for Liberia, one backup plan after another fell through and Kat was facing the death chamber. (Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there was never a chance we would have let that happen, but we did end up scrambling a bit.) Karl kept Kat a few more days and then Mom and my grandma drove down to pick her up. They took Kat back up to Roseburg and got an article placed in the local newspaper about Kat\u0026rsquo;s story. A huge number of leads turned up, but the obvious choice was to send Kat back to her home in California. A family from Santa Cruz who was visiting relatives in Roseburg adopted Kat. They\u0026rsquo;ve even asked me to come see them when I am next in Santa Cruz. Looking forward to it!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/07/02/made-it-to-nimba-county/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn Friday, Jerome and I made the drive up to Nimba County.

I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward, nonetheless, to getting back to the team house in a while and taking a nice cold shower.\nI had briefings all day, and also took a little walk. I dropped by MSF-Belgium to see Leo, who departed New York for Liberia on the same day I did. He\u0026rsquo;s got a bottle of whiskey that I need to trade with him due to our poor planning with respect to duty-free shopping! I\u0026rsquo;m also trying to find the phone number for International Medical Corps in Monrovia to find out when Jon will be here so that maybe we can meet up.\nMy briefings are boring, because they necessarily cover ground that other briefings have covered. But there\u0026rsquo;s new stuff mixed in, so you really have to keep on your toes to get it all. The best briefings come from the national staff, who are really excited and serious about their jobs, and enjoy teaching me about them.

Leave it to me to come all the way to Liberia, then forget which country Brussels is in\u0026hellip; sigh.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve met so many people, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep track, but I\u0026rsquo;m doing my best.

The next morning I drove to Portland and commenced work on the Humaninet Simulation Day event.\nThat came off as well as I expected. Things didn\u0026rsquo;t work perfectly, but we showed, in addition to the technical capabilities we were demonstrating, that we can overcome problems and make the show go on. The biggest challenge for Humaninet right now is finding a Jeff replacement; I did all of my work for them knowing I\u0026rsquo;d be leaving, so it\u0026rsquo;s all documented. But it does take a certain set of skills to manage the technology side of a show like that. I\u0026rsquo;ve recommended a friend to them, and they are going to follow up with him this week about maybe volunteering. (Sorry Brent!)\nIt was also a chance to get back into management mode, as I knew from experience that it takes a very strong leader with a clear vision to make a network come together in a hurry. I\u0026rsquo;d like to think I was a benevolent dictator, but I do remember dropping the axe on at least one guy during the day: I pointedly rearranged his priorities when I found him arranging marketing materials for a technical demonstration which he hadn\u0026rsquo;t proved worked yet.

It was factually very useful to me, and my mom found it very comforting to see that real people go off on (and come back from) MSF missions and have enough fun to write about it in a fun personal way when they get back. I gave her a 1 pound (500 gram) budget in my bag for her to send stuff.

Jon also gave me some useful pointers on pants (cotton + equator = mildew).

My references, who resisted the temptation to sabotage my job search in order to keep me in the US to work for them.

In the interview I got a number of chances to explain how I think my past experiences will help me do the job. Molly asked me how I\u0026rsquo;d deal with the inevitable problems of close team living, and I had an answer that I think pleased her.\nYesterday, I studied diesel engine failure modes and basics of water systems, and both of those showed up on the test. Many of the questions on the test have some pretty serious problems, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think MSF-USA takes it terribly seriously. Hope not because I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t ace it.\nOne strange thing is that between the interview and the test she had me watch a 30 minute movie. It was all stuff I knew from reading so much about life as an MSF volunteer, but I suppose it would have answered a lot of questions for me when I first got started researching this stuff.\nIn a month or so they will tell me if I\u0026rsquo;ve made it onto their roster of volunteers. At that point, I\u0026rsquo;ll work with the HR department to find my first posting. Between now and then, I was planning on taking a big long camping trip of some sort.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know if my interviewer will ask about first aid skills, but I can guarantee you that I\u0026rsquo;ll find a way to tell her! I\u0026rsquo;m really proud of this certification, not just because of the skills it gives me in case I need to provide emergency care for a colleague someplace remote, but because it shows I have taken the initiative to continue preparing myself for my chosen career. You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think, while working with doctors and nurses, that you\u0026rsquo;d need to know medicine, but Jon told me a story from his MSF days that made me decide to get the WFR training. He found himself in a situation where he was the best hope half a dozen meningitis patients had to survive the next 24 hours\u0026hellip; as he said, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to work that way, but sometimes it does\u0026rdquo;.\nOne of the high points of the course for me was getting to give a 0.3 ml dose of saline via intramuscular injection to a classmate. The point of the exercise was to make sure that if we ever had to inject someone with epinephrine, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t shy away from it, possibly costing someone their life. I also want to learn how to run an IV drip, but that\u0026rsquo;s harder to arrange here in the States, due to liability and such. People only want to teach you stuff like that when you are in a nursing or paramedic course. So perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll have to have my colleagues teach me when I get my first posting.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also finished all my Red Cross paperwork so that they will be able to deploy me the next time there\u0026rsquo;s a national disaster inside of the United States big enough to justify bringing in volunteers from the Pacific Region. Through amateur radio circles, I\u0026rsquo;ve made contact with a Red Cross volunteer who\u0026rsquo;s worked several times for the communications part of Red Cross, so I might get his help to be deployed on one of those teams.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also in the final stages of getting signed up for DMAT CA-6, a federally chartered medical team that FEMA can call up to work in disaster areas. At least I think I am; it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell if the interview component, which is yet to happen, is a real \u0026ldquo;weed-out\u0026rdquo; step, or if it\u0026rsquo;s just to make sure I\u0026rsquo;m not insane. They have a big drill coming the first week of May, so I am trying to get involved with the team before that so that I can at least see the team in operation, and maybe learn on the job some. I am applying to work on that team in a logistical or communication role. I provided an internet connection to a DMAT-like team in Waveland, and they seemed like cool people. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing the CA-6 folks will be pretty much the same. The kinds of nurses and doctors that volunteer for stuff like that are the cool ones.\nIn my digital life, I\u0026rsquo;ve got some programming work to finish up tonight and the rest of this week so I can bill that client. Yay for money! I\u0026rsquo;m visiting a non-profit up in the city tomorrow to see if I can be helpful to them, but that\u0026rsquo;s just a volunteer thing. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple proposals for contracting work in process, but they are in the customer\u0026rsquo;s hands, so no telling when/if they will come through. I\u0026rsquo;m also committed to delivering a prototype of a search system to a guy at the UN this month; that\u0026rsquo;s also volunteer work, but the idea is it might turn into a job some day.\nAs I explained to my Guatemalan teacher, I plant mango stones and see which trees bear fruit.\nThe good news is that I\u0026rsquo;ve made enough money this year that I actually need to get around to paying estimated taxes for 2006 by April 15. I already did 2005\u0026rsquo;s taxes, and ended up paying a little penalty because I never got around to paying my self-employment taxes when I was supposed to.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/04/04/woofer-for-hire/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJust in time for my upcoming MSF interview, I\u0026rsquo;ve finished my WFR (pronounced \u0026ldquo;woofer\u0026rdquo;) certification.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been hanging around the Bay Area. I did a contract for my old boss at his new employer, and some other random undirected hanging out I can\u0026rsquo;t really remember. Oh, I think it involved postponing writing code by taking the dog to the dog park. I\u0026rsquo;ve also been working on the unread books from my bibliography, including some new ones I found. One is really gripping; it is a memoir of a Canadian nurse who worked for MSF for four years. So much of what she says is familiar to me after all my reading.\nTo save you the effort of reading all those books, the stories she tells that are repeated time and again in other books are:\nFeeling overwhelmed and scared for the first week, especially the first hour, when the MSF driver who was supposed to meet her at the airport wasn\u0026rsquo;t there. Arriving at her posting to find that things have changed and she\u0026rsquo;s doing a different job than she expected. Noticing and remarking on the beauty of the land in the middle of human cruelty. Mentioning the somewhat uncoordinated, or at least \u0026ldquo;fiercely independent\u0026rdquo; nature of the various MSFs. Trouble at checkpoints, culminating in getting thrown in jail for a few hours. Feeling guilt and loss when leaving a mission, and wondering what happened to national staff who simply disappeared when the fighting in their home village got too bad. Mentioning that the logisticians (\u0026ldquo;loggies\u0026rdquo;) keep things running, and that when you find a good one you should marry him. Thus\u0026hellip; Meeting a husband who is a logistician, including the almost cliche of falling in love and starting a relationship in the middle of a war. Feeling a space open up between her and friends and family from \u0026ldquo;before\u0026rdquo;, who simply can\u0026rsquo;t understand her new life. The regularity with which all these stories are repeated in all the books is either due to the fact that because they make for good books editors crave them, or the fact they are unifying features of the life I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen for myself. Let\u0026rsquo;s just assume it\u0026rsquo;s the editors, ok? Not enough of those are happy fun things for me to be looking forward to them.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been looking into Geographic Information Systems some. I want to turn my local city park into a refugee camp, including a nifty map like they make at the Humanitarian Information Centre for Darfur. Paul told me to start off with pencil, paper, and my boots. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like nearly as much fun as spending hours trying to understand GIS software from the comfort of my house!\nThe other cool thing I arranged for myself is an 80 hour first aid course. When I\u0026rsquo;m done on April 3, I will be a WMI Wilderness First Responder (WFR, pronounced \u0026ldquo;woofer\u0026rdquo;). That\u0026rsquo;s pretty much one step (and about 80 hours) below Wilderness EMT. It means I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to take care of patients for days before \u0026ldquo;definitive care\u0026rdquo; like a hospital is available to my patient. To give you yet one more idea, WFR is typically required for the leader of guided wilderness expeditions.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking for a while that taking an EMT course would help me relate to the doctors and nurses I meet in MSF, not to mention make me more useful in case of a medical emergency where I was the only one available to respond to it. I talked to Jon a while back and ran the idea by him. He agreed, but also agreed with me that any training that assumed I had the infrastructure available to me that United States EMTs have (i.e. fully stocked ambulances and hospitals within 10 minutes) would be useless. So I found a wilderness course, and I\u0026rsquo;m really glad I did.\nSo far I\u0026rsquo;ve had two days of classes. The course is excellent. I would recommend WMI to anyone. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about the rest of the industry, but it is clear to me that they put a very high value on professionalism, both in the material they are teaching me (which is governed by a board of licensed physicians) and in the teachers themselves.\nSo, now it is time to hit bed and do some reading before tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s classes start again at 8 am.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/03/26/wilderness-first-responder-in-the-making/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t posted in a while.

It was fun to see people that I\u0026rsquo;d met in Hancock County again, and the hard work I\u0026rsquo;d put in to the supporting documentation paid off. I saw several people reading my report.\nOne interesting thing was that though everyone was dressed in suits to show proper respect for the proceedings, some people were \u0026ldquo;suits\u0026rdquo;, and some people were just \u0026ldquo;in suits\u0026rdquo;. There were a whole lot of vendors there with their hands out trying to sell something. Everyone could tell within the first few words our of their mouth. What kept it interesting was that both on the panel, and of the invited speakers, there was at least 30%, maybe more, who were just \u0026ldquo;in suits\u0026rdquo;. They were people like me who had real-world experience, didn\u0026rsquo;t care for meetings, or having their time wasted, or getting sales pitches. They were there to make things better, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of patience with people who weren\u0026rsquo;t there for the same reason. Very inspiring.\nThe talk went very well. I easily had time, and participated a bit in the discussion afterwards.\nIn virtually every panel, people were talking about interoperability. The resuce workers want it, the vendors keep saying, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll have it as soon as you upgrade your entire networks to all use our new fancy radios\u0026rdquo;. It would have been funny if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t so sad. I realized we\u0026rsquo;d already showed interopability when we\u0026rsquo;d taken laptops from first responders from all over the nation and let them connect over VPNs back to their home office and do email with each other. I pointed this out in my talk, and said, \u0026ldquo;IP stands for internet protocol, but it might as well stand for Interoperability Protocol\u0026rdquo;. That quote got picked up by the next speaker down the table, and it clearly resonated with the crowd.\nAnother thing that was really meaningful to me was when Sheriff Kevin Beary of Orange County Police Department spoke up. He told me that the work my team had done was the kind of hands on problem solving and lesson learning that we needed and that he was proud of the initiative it showed. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember his words exactly, but the undercurrent was, \u0026ldquo;people like you make the difference, not expensive systems from the sales guys\u0026rdquo;.\nIn response to a pointed question by a fire chief about \u0026ldquo;when will your system and motorola\u0026rsquo;s system work together\u0026rdquo;, a vendor danced around it and gave an unconvincing argument (I think it was MA/Com). I decided to open a can of whopass on the vendors and spoke up. I said, \u0026ldquo;Look, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for moto or ma/com to deliver interoperability to you. You need to find an independent consultant, get their help to choose commodity parts that use IP, and build your network just like we built ours. You can have interoperability today. Stop waiting for the vendors to solve your problems, and show them that the marketplace is only buying open systems.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother cool thing is that Commissioner Deborah Tate was there for much of the discussion. She gave a little speech when she had to leave, listing lessons she\u0026rsquo;d heard that she was going to take back to DC. There were 10 or 15, but two I\u0026rsquo;d mentioned made the cut: education for emergency responders on the benefits of unlicensed spectrum and IP = interoperability. (She didn\u0026rsquo;t use my quote, but she clearly got the idea, because it had been hit by so many people, including me.)\nSo, it was a trip well worth making!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/03/08/how-my-talk-went/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy talk on Monday went just fine.

(I\u0026rsquo;m a cheapskate.) It\u0026rsquo;s Google Engineering at it\u0026rsquo;s finest; the simplest thing that will work, and no simpler. When you click to see a movie in the Google Video Player, you download a tiny text file (with file extension GVP). That causes the Google Video Player to launch. It reads the file and starts to download the video via HTTP, just like the Flash player is doing in the web browser. The GVP file is just a text file, so you can open it and find the URL. If you fetch the URL yourself with wget (i.e. no cookies, no javascript, etc) you get a big binary stream. The content-type claims that it is \u0026ldquo;video/x-msvideo\u0026rdquo;, but it does not play in Windows Media Player.\nI took a look at the header of the file, and the first four bytes are \u0026ldquo;RIFF\u0026rdquo;. Using File::Format::RIFF , I took a look inside the file and found that it starts with a LIST of type \u0026ldquo;goog\u0026rdquo;, which has inside it a chunk of type \u0026ldquo;GDAT\u0026rdquo; that is 32 bytes long. AVICodec is willing to overlook this extra data, but Windows Media Player and WinAmp don\u0026rsquo;t. Later, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to remove the Google extensions to the AVI file and see if I can get WinAmp to play it. Here\u0026rsquo;s what AVICodec sees inside the AVI file:\nFile : 9.91 MB (9.91 MB), duration: 0:02:34, type: AVI, 1 audio stream(s), quality: 46 % Video : 7.56 MB, 411 Kbps, 30.0 fps, 480*360 (4:3), divx = OpenDivx v4, Supported Audio : 2.34 MB, 128 Kbps, 44100 Hz, 2 channels, 0x55 = MPEG Layer-3, Supported So, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing fancy about the data; it\u0026rsquo;s Divx video and MP3 audio. There\u0026rsquo;s just a litte extra data in there gumming up the works.\nWhen I went to buy my first video, I checked out the terms of service. They are located here. The interesting thing, which you can tell from the way the TOS are worded, is that you are signing up for a generalized payment processing system, not for a video purchase system. That\u0026rsquo;s a big deal, and an under-reported one. Some bloggers discovered the Google Purchases system in October, but no one in the press is talking about it right now.\nThe TOS says that I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing business with Google Payment Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary or Google. The other surprising thing is that it clearly says that GPC will not charge a service fee. As a video publisher, I know that if I choose to have Google collect fees for me, they reserve the right to take a portion of the fees, so it\u0026rsquo;s not like they are running Google Purchases for free or anything.\nWhen you go to confirm the purchase, here are the final three reminders you get:\nRequires Internet connection to watch Requires Windows 2000 or XP All sales final There is also a small note saying, \u0026ldquo;Google processes video sales but is not the seller.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce the purchase is completed, you download a GVP file, just like with the free movies. It is formatted precisely the same. And fetching the video content outside of the Google Video Player also works fine. So that\u0026rsquo;s one interesting bit: the copy-protected files travel over vanilla HTTP, no cookies required. If you know the URL for a file someone purchased, you can download it. Playing it is a different matter, of course.\nI took a look at the header of the copy-protected file while it was downloading. It has the same format, with the LIST of type \u0026ldquo;goog\u0026rdquo; and a chunk named GDAT. But there\u0026rsquo;s two extra chunks named \u0026ldquo;DRMI\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;drmh\u0026rdquo;. After that the AVI file seems to be about the same, but the chunks of video and audio are undoubtedly encrypted.\nWhen you go to play the copy protected file, it works just like iTunes. The file indicates that it is copy protected, and the viewer talks to Google via SSL. I presume it submits your username, password, and the video id, and in return gets a key to decrypt it. If you try to play the file without a network connection, it fails, even after I\u0026rsquo;d watched it once, which means they chose not to use a key caching file, like Apple\u0026rsquo;s iTunes did. Good thing too, because that\u0026rsquo;s the feature that made it possible to break iTunes\u0026rsquo; DRM system.\nGoogle Video Player said, \u0026ldquo;checking for updates\u0026rdquo;, and then downloaded a decoder of some sort. Due to operator error, I didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to capture that in Ethereal, so I\u0026rsquo;ll have to try again sometime to make that happen. Finally the video played. The framerate and colors were very disappointing, bordering on unwatchable. It might be better once the entire file has loaded, but once Google Video Player got a good long ways ahead of the paused video, it stopped downloading.\nAll in all, an interesting way to spent $1.99, but not something I\u0026rsquo;d ever do again probably.\nUpdate: When you strip out the \u0026ldquo;goog\u0026rdquo; list from the front of a GVI file, you get a valid AVI that will play in Windows Media Player and WinAmp. The following script, called gvi2avi will convert a GVI to an AVI:\n#!/usr/bin/perl -w use File::Format::RIFF; my ( $riff1 ) = File::Format::RIFF-\u0026gt;read( *STDIN ); $riff1-\u0026gt;shift(); $riff1-\u0026gt;write( *STDOUT ); An unmodified GVI file (i.e. with the \u0026ldquo;goog\u0026rdquo; list intact) will play correctly in VLC.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2006/01/10/google-video-hacking/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI decided to look into Google Video a bit, now that they are selling stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst things first, I looked into how the Google Video Player works for free files.

I\u0026rsquo;ve never really minded paying taxes, and though I have some complaints with the complexity of our tax code, I know that\u0026rsquo;s not the IRS\u0026rsquo;s fault. They do the best they can with the mess given to them each year by congress. I think the way the IRS does e-filing is stupid, but I suspect it\u0026rsquo;s one of those things that simply can\u0026rsquo;t be any better than it is, for a bunch of reasons out of control of the reasonable people at the IRS. (There are unreasonable people everywhere, even at the IRS.)\nI don\u0026rsquo;t mind paying taxes, and in fact I\u0026rsquo;d be happy to pay more. I believe we are undertaxed, and though I can\u0026rsquo;t remember where I saw it, I have seen apolitical analyses by neutral economists that show that Americans are undertaxed, when you compare our expectations of government to the objective cost of delivering that government.\nDue to some unnecessary complexity the Congress added to the tax code, I had a problem with my IRA contributions in 2002. I filed for an extension, and promptly forgot about it. Quite a while later, I got a reminder from the IRS that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t filed my taxes, and then I got things fixed up, almost. It appears I either didn\u0026rsquo;t send in the fixed tax return for some reason, or I did send it in but it got lost. I was a bit distracted, as it was between trips this year (I think between London and Guatemala, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really remember). Also, I was irritated that the tax preparer I had used (this being the first year I owned a house) had definitely not made things easier for me. Never going to use a tax preparer again, ever. Karl was right: human interaction is bad; e-file via TurboTax is the only way to go.\nSo, when I got home I had a tax bill for $37,000 from the IRS. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really panic too much because I know my rights, and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that they owed me, if anything. And though I was aware I had pushed things into the penalty zone, I figured the penalty would likely be less than what they owed me. I finally sat down and figured out where their number came from today by comparing their return to the one the incompetent tax preparer from hell begrudglingly gave me once I threatened to sue her. The problem was that the IRS was missing the basis price on a stock sale I made to help buy the house. Instead of showing my profit as $2000, they were showing it as $70000. Right, like I went out and picked the stock shares off the money tree in my front yard.\nI called the IRS to clarify how to get this fixed, and to make sure I understood the state of all my other returns. The lady who picked up the phone there was really nice, and explained things very well. She did a really good job of telling me what deadlines were coming up, and what to expect to happen. And she agreed with me that though I have really screwed this up so far, I can still get our of trouble by just doing the paperwork right. Which I did today, sending it with certified mail and return receipt, just to be sure.\nThe mail from the IRS was politely worded. It was evidentally written my humans, not lawyers or compters. It was easy to understand what they were threatening to do, and how to make it stop. They also included several useful pamphlets I could have read, and an 800 number to call an agent and talk one on one. I was on hold for less than 5 minutes, and the lady was courteous. The hold music sucked, but you can\u0026rsquo;t really have everything, right?\nI just wanted to post this so that if I ever get audited (or if this self-imposed fiasco triggers an audit) I\u0026rsquo;ll remember how nice the collections/late filing part of the IRS is. Hopefully the audit people will be as nice. (My grandfather was audited one time, and the auditor found some tax savings for him. She wanted to re-file to get him his rebate, but he said, no, let\u0026rsquo;s just get this over with, keep the extra money. Smart man.)\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/12/06/i-love-the-irs/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI like the IRS.

There will be about 400 mesh nodes, and 3 uplinks to the Internet (which Google says will use fiber, as though the media really matters). The system will use a captive portal, requiring you to log in. The username and password will be a Google account (i.e. the same one as Gtalk, Gmail, customized homepage, etc.) The tinfoil-hat crowd will point out that this will allow Google to snoop all your packets and associate them will all of your e-mail and your chat logs. The installs will be on city-owned light poles. Parts of Mountain View will not get service immediately because their light poles are owned by PGE and Google and the city have to negotiate with PGE more. Don\u0026rsquo;t hold your breath on this, folks. PGE\u0026rsquo;s probably got some powerline Internet thing it wants to do instead. The equipment taps power to the light poles, and as such is unmetered. Google will pay $36 per pole per year for power. That\u0026rsquo;s $0.0041 per hour. If electricity costs the city 4 cents per kilowatt hour, that means the devices use 100 watts of power. Seems like a fair price. There is no mention of solar power or battery backup, which means that this system will be useless for disaster response. Also, because the equipment taps the utility power for the lights, it will not be possible to use generator power to fix some portion of the mesh. Finally, if street light circuits were de-prioritized for repair by the power company during an emergency (as seems likely), the Google wifi mesh would come back slower than other networking technologies. There is talk of running a VLAN over the network in the future for city services use. It is not going to be in 1.0. The security aspects of having city services data running over a wireless mesh would need to be thought about. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying it\u0026rsquo;s a bad idea, but it\u0026rsquo;s a sizable liability for Google to take on. There are grainy, useless pictures of the proposed hardware. No surprise, it looks like commodity stuff. Google\u0026rsquo;s value-add will be in software. There is no discussion of how the boxes will get installed. I suspect Google will contract that job out to someone with a fleet of boom trucks. Perhaps they will have Peek do it, who you see around town fixing traffic lights. This project is significant for more than the normal \u0026ldquo;Telcos Battle Municipal Wifi\u0026rdquo; reason. This is going to be a real mesh network. Mesh networking is one of those urban legends among networking people. Everyone says that they are nifty, but no one has ever seen one work. Perhaps Google will nail this like they have so many other things.\nOn a related note, there\u0026rsquo;s a site called wifi.google.com. It redirects you to the Google personalized homepage. But by searching for all the links Google knows about to wifi.google.com I found more info. In particular, I found this FAQ about something called Google Secure Access (BETA). When you try to download it, you get a page saying they have turned off downloads. But you can still download it via one of the links the web search above turned up. After I installed it, I took a look at the about box. It says, \u0026ldquo;Tunc tua res agitur, Paries cum proximus ardet.\u0026rdquo; Which is Greek (well, ok, Latin) to me. (Someone on the net translated: \u0026ldquo;It is your problem when your neighbor\u0026rsquo;s wall is burning.\u0026rdquo;)\nNow, Google says clearly that this won\u0026rsquo;t work for me on my home Internet connection. I need to go to one of their hotspots to see it working. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop me from playing, does it?\nWhen you tell it to connect, it tries to open a PPTP connection to 66.28.250.33. But who owns that IP address? The reverse DNS says \u0026ldquo;plsf2internet.putnamlovellnbf.com\u0026rdquo;. Is that a mistake? What the heck is Putnam Lovell NBF, an investment bank, doing running a PPTP server for Google to connect to?\nUpdate: As of Jan 2007, vpn.google.com points at addresses in the NET-64-9-224-0-1 block, which is named GOOGLE-WIFI-MV. Hmm, no more Putnam Lovell NBF.\nLater, after timing out or something, it popped up a normal Windows VPN signin box. I typed my Google username and password, and it started to try to connect to vpn.google.com. I did a name lookup, and got these back: 66.28.250.23, 66.28.250.25, 66.28.250.26, 66.28.250.27. Those are from the same IP address range, so they are also owned by Putnam Lovell NBF. Why is a Google DNS name pointing at addresses owned by someone else? (And why did no one else notice this but me? This story broke back in September, and 1000 people posted ways to make Mac and Linux PPTP implementations work with the same servers.)\nMy guess is this is Google\u0026rsquo;s answer to the criticism that them hosting a VPN server makes it possible for them to snoop all your data. They set up some kind of escrow agreement with Putnam Lovell so that they can provide this service, but have a trusted intermediary in the loop. But the interesting thing is that it cuts Google off from doing anything clever in their network to implement PPTP.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/11/29/google-wifi/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eInfo on Google\u0026rsquo;s proposal to the City of Mountain View to put in a WiFi network is \u003ca href=\"http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/google-mv-wifi.pdf\"\u003epublically available\u003c/a\u003e (490K PDF).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some interesting things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt will be using mesh technology.

(Yes, on the water tower, 100 feet up.) We put in a long day of debugging in the lab before we went, then working on the tower when we got into the field to install the equipment. So when we got off the tower, I was looking forward to dinner. We\u0026rsquo;d worked too late for dinner at Waveland Cafe, and Don had already declared tonight Pizza Night. We\u0026rsquo;d noticed that the pizzaria had won the \u0026ldquo;first restaurant to reopen\u0026rdquo; contest, and were looking forward to spending a little money in Hancock County. Turns out, it is a lunch place that closes at 4pm, so we missed dinner there. We came back to the completely remodeled Sonic drive-in (complete with girls on skates!) and had dinner. I ordered a large Coke, which might explain why I\u0026rsquo;m wired and not asleep right now.\nToday, I assigned the intern (turns out interns actually have names, who knew? Ours is Matt Justice) the job of installing a computer lab here at the FEMA Camp where the contractors and volunteers stay. It had been a low priority thing, since we originally thought that all the residents here would be contractors, and we figured that at the inflated rates FEMA is paying for the work, they could find their own way to call home. We brought Internet here, but left it at wi-fi, figuring people with laptops would find it, and those without would find someone with a laptop. After living here a while, we found that a whole lot of volunteer groups come through, and that it made sense to support them with phones and a computer lab.\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s why we decided to put a lab here. The cool thing is that I told Matt to git\u0026rsquo;r\u0026rsquo;done, and he did. I got a call from him this evening (while I was on the water tower) and he proudly told me the lab was up and running. It\u0026rsquo;s his first independent assignment with us, and I\u0026rsquo;m really proud of him for taking care of it so well. I\u0026rsquo;m also happy to have it available to me to use tonight, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to dig my laptop out from under a huge pile of crap in my car.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t fit into a blog entry, so it\u0026rsquo;s getting lumped into this one.\nGuatemalan Relief\nAfter Hurricane Rita came Hurricane Stan. It hit Guatemala and other Central American countries as a force one hurricane, but it still dumped enough rain to cause havoc in the region.\nI intend to write an appeal in a few days, when I get time, for donations to help an ex-coworker who lost his house in the landslides in Guatemala. He and his family survived, but he needs to replace his house. Any money we raise will go to Planet Outreach\u0026rsquo;s US non-profit, which will move the money down to Guatemala via bank transfer, as they usually do for funds for operating expenses. Ventura\u0026rsquo;s boss will spend the money as he sees fit, probably mostly in the form of a grant to Ventura for reconstruction expenses.\nPlease watch for it, and think about if you\u0026rsquo;d like to help. I don\u0026rsquo;t want this to turn into some kind of charity blog, but Guatemala\u0026rsquo;s run-in with Hurricane Stan is a disaster that hit close to home for me, and one step removed for you, since you all read about my time there.\nThanks\nA while ago I was sitting at the New Waveland Cafe eating dinner. A woman who was clearly a resident of Waveland said thanks to me. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t thanks for anything in particular, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really to me. She said it in a distracted way, with empty eyes, and it was hanging out there like a ping to the broadcast address. (Uh, non-techies: like a shout in the dark.)\nIt was spooky and I felt sorry for her, but she moved on and I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to engage her in conversation and listen to her story. I think she\u0026rsquo;d gotten into a bit of a rut where the adrenalin rush of making decisions and taking care of herself had worn off and she\u0026rsquo;d fallen back onto just saying thanks to people reflexively. I hope she bounced back. There is mental health counseling available as freely as the medical care, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much it is being used.\nWaveland Town Meeting\nI went to a City of Waveland town meeting that I heard advertised on the radio. I went to see how local government was relating to the people, and to see if I could find leads for our work at Radio Response. I struck out on the latter, but learned a lot about the former.\nThe mayor, Tommy, presided. (I never heard his last name. He knew many of the attendees by their first names too.) He did a really wonderful job of making it clear he was fighting for his town, and convincing his residents to have faith, and patience, and determination. A number of times I was overwhelmed with the resolve and strength of the people in the room. One man attempted to use the forum to air his frustration with the buracracy (and Tommy in particular), but he was shut down by a woman in the crowd who politely told him to complain in some other venue, not the one dedicated to getting info out to the residents. Very inspiring.\nThe bulk of the meeting was spent discussing how to get moving on rebuilding. There are layers of red tape keeping people from getting trailers, and getting permits to rebuild. Some make sense, and Tommy did his best to lay out the case for why they are needed. He even explained that when he\u0026rsquo;d gone to experts to protest the delays, they explained why, and convinced him of the need. For instance, the Waveland water system south of the tracks has to be rebuilt from scratch due to the incredible amount of damage to it. Some people want their water turned on before the other connections on the street are fixed, but that poses a health risk because even the valves are broken making it impossible to prevent contaminated water from flowing back into the system. Tommy continues to resist their requests, and people aren\u0026rsquo;t happy about that. People can\u0026rsquo;t get FEMA trailers until all three utilities (water, sewer, and electricity) are turned on. One man pointed out that he needed power now to start drying out his house without spending $24 a day on gasoline for the generator.\nThe three-utility rule seemed to me really stupid. Afterall, there is free water and prepared food and bathroom access all over town, so people don\u0026rsquo;t need water and black water service. All it would take is to take one of the shiny new shower trailers FEMA rents for us volunteers and make it available to citizens, and they could live in a trailer with only one of the three utilities: electricity. (Living in a tin can here in the south without air conditioning would be impossible. Even in October.)\nThis is a common problem here, in my opinion. If you are ever in a disaster, pretend you are a volunteer, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get treated WAY better than the citizens. Also, clear out of the region. The evacuees from New Orleans that wandered off the street into the Palo Alto Chapter of the Red Cross almost got mobbed by volunteers anxious to help them.\nTommy also said that the police have already arrested 37 looters. He said he spoke to one guy himself, and the guy\u0026rsquo;s excuse was \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s just trash, the debris haulers will take it, but I can sell this scrap metal\u0026rdquo;. Tommy told him, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve lost everything we own. That trash is all we have left. You\u0026rsquo;re going to jail, and when you get out, you\u0026rsquo;re going to stay out of here, or you\u0026rsquo;re going to go back to jail and never get out!\u0026rdquo; The crowd cheered.\nThere was talk of the Mississippi Renewal Project that\u0026rsquo;s been launched up in Jackson. It\u0026rsquo;s an effort by architects and new urban planning people from all over the country to convince Gulf Coast cities to rebuild in the new urban model, which looks just like the maps of old European cities. (Which is pretty funny, because the outskirts of European cities look just like American sprawl \u0026ndash; Wal-Mart included.)\nTo the new urbanism people: BACK OFF. Everyone understands where you are coming from, and what you have to offer. People might even take what you have to offer, if you don\u0026rsquo;t make asses of yourselves first. From the tone in the room, I\u0026rsquo;d say you are about one short step shy of stepping over the line already. You have to take it easy and show respect to local people. We\u0026rsquo;ve been helped immensely by having Mac be our ambassador to the people of Mississippi. And Matt, my intern, always reminds me to slow down and walk like a local when I get excited and start walking like a Californian.\nDirections\nDirections here are funny. It\u0026rsquo;s just like any small town; \u0026ldquo;turn left where the bank used to be, then right where the supermarket was, etc.\u0026rdquo; The thing is, the wreckage of the bank and the supermarket are still there, so it\u0026rsquo;s marginally easier to follow the directions \u0026ndash; once you get good at recognizing what a building used to be from a pile of debris.\nOne time I was giving directions, and I swear to God this was what I said:\nGo to the first stoplight that\u0026rsquo;s out and turn right. Turn left at the Burger King with the boat in the drive through. When you get to the house on it\u0026rsquo;s side leaning against the telephone pole, turn right. At the blown-down stop sign turn right. That\u0026rsquo;s Washington St., but I think it\u0026rsquo;s only spray painted on the white house that\u0026rsquo;s missing it\u0026rsquo;s roof. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother looking for a street sign. Go down Washington until there\u0026rsquo;s a mobile home on the street. Drive around it and pull into the driveway the mobile home is sitting on. (To the people in Waveland trying to follow these directions, don\u0026rsquo;t bother. It\u0026rsquo;s a made up example. But y\u0026rsquo;all probably know where each of these places actually are, right? )\nLanguage\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve done several times this year, I picked up the local dialect. I proudly use git\u0026rsquo;r\u0026rsquo;done, fixin\u0026rsquo; to, and y\u0026rsquo;all whenever proper (Southern) English rules of grammar demand their use. The second person plural is quite helpful, and it\u0026rsquo;s really a shame y\u0026rsquo;all don\u0026rsquo;t have anything like it up north. My mother caught me saying \u0026ldquo;nuthin\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; on the phone tonight, and I proudly informed her that not only do I say \u0026ldquo;nuthin\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;, I also say \u0026ldquo;ain\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo;. And I ain\u0026rsquo;t fixin\u0026rsquo; to change nuthin\u0026rsquo;, either.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been disappointed that I have not yet had a legitimate chance to use the posessive second person plural (\u0026ldquo;all y\u0026rsquo;all\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo;). I\u0026rsquo;ve heard it used, but not gotten to say it yet. Hope springs eternal!\nHaving stayed past a month, I\u0026rsquo;m apparently not just a Yankee. Yankees eventually go home. Damn Yankees come and stay.\nFuture\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some talk of Radio Response getting funding and becoming a real organization and needing an employee to stay on and run things in preparation for next hurricane season. That won\u0026rsquo;t be me. I\u0026rsquo;m satisfied to fulfill my committments here, and then move on.\nMy last day here is October 26. After that, I\u0026rsquo;ll head up to Seattle via Colorado and Burns OR (some route, huh?) to see my (soon to be) newborn nephew and try out being an uncle to see if I like it. (I guess I better like it, it\u0026rsquo;s not like you really get a choice in these things!)\nI expect to start applying for a job with MSF as soon as I get home to start house-sitting for Karl. I\u0026rsquo;ll give them an availability date of Jan 1-ish, and see what turns up. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten notifcations via my RedR contacts that jobs are opening up in Pakistan for the relief effort there. I guess Pakistan would be as good a place as any to have my first mission. At least there would be some English there. And I think I still prefer a mountain climate to a tropical one.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/10/17/late-night-thoughts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis afternoon and into the evening I was working on the Waveland water tower.

He\u0026rsquo;s been doing double duty back at his farm, both doing deferred maintenance on his own network, and doing Radio Response office work. But double duty left little time for communications, so it\u0026rsquo;s been difficult to stay in touch.

Alas, that\u0026rsquo;s the facts of life.\nOne of the things I am good at is making decisions independently and then taking responsibility for either making them stick, or fixing them if I was wrong.

They have this expectation that things will work, and when they don\u0026rsquo;t they come find us and ask us to stop everything and fix our network.

The radios have power, but the channels are getting noisy. The FCC Part 15 rules, which define how signals are supposed to coexist in the 900, 2400, and 5800 Mhz unlicensed bands are pretty clear. There are things you can do to be a good citizen, and things you can do in the face of noise to keep your stuff running. Overall the system works astonishingly well. But there\u0026rsquo;s a new player on the scene, Motorola Canopy. The way it has been described to me, the Canopy radio system is within the letter of the law, but still manages to wipe everyone else off the net by raising the noise level for everyone but itself. The key \u0026ldquo;innovation\u0026rdquo; that Canopy introduced is time syncronization among the radios in the network. So a group of radios in on the time sync plan can work together to ignore each other\u0026rsquo;s noise. Everyone else, like the off the shelf 802.11b, the Trango AP\u0026rsquo;s we are using, etc, sees all the noise. That\u0026rsquo;s not playing fair, but there is nothing in the Part 15 rules that preclude it, since the FCC did not envision radios using time synchronization to flood the channels.\nAlas, the people who reportedly bought the Canopy system in Gulfport are FEMA. We aren\u0026rsquo;t in a very good bargaining position with them. They can play the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re the government, we\u0026rsquo;re doing important work, you\u0026rsquo;re just amatuers\u0026rdquo; card. All we can play is is the \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re dicks, and you bought a bad system from an evil vendor\u0026rdquo; card. Their suit is trump.\nSo this morning we put into effect a backup plan to feed the critical parts of our network from a satellite feed here. We\u0026rsquo;ve shut down parts of our distribution network so that the satellite-provided bandwidth is limited to sites that have a legitimate need for it. Shelters will have to wait for Internet access until we can fix the link to Gulfport.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another group doing work like us in Slidell, Louisiana. We are looking into conneting into them, which will work until someone brings up a Motorola Canopy system there and knocks us back off the air.\nAll this among frustrating attempts to improve the network at client sites. Hot tip: you can\u0026rsquo;t shoot 802.11b through the magnetic field of a 75 kvA generator, especially if the 100 foot path also includes two refer trucks with big diesel engines. Diesel engines, thankfully, don\u0026rsquo;t make electrical noise, but those big heavy engine blocks probably sucked up a bunch of our signal. We gave up (way too late) and ran a 600 foot Ethernet run. (At least I got to go in the girl\u0026rsquo;s showers to scope out a place to put an intermediate switch to regenerate the signal, should that have prevented the long run from linking right!)\nTwo interns from Mississippi State University have showed up. They will be doing 300 hours each of volunteer time to fulfill an internship requirement for graduation. They report to me. So far, I have used them a little for tech help, and a lot for gofer tasks. That\u0026rsquo;s the nature of being an intern. As I get to know them better, and they start picking stuff up the gofer stuff should let up a bit. I\u0026rsquo;ve assigned one a longer term project that he should learn a lot from (making a transparent caching proxy). I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about what to assign the other one\u0026hellip; network management would have been a logical choice, but that was too pressing to wait for an intern to figure it out. The big picure plan for this network is for those of us that built it to clear out when the building is done and leave it in the hands of the interns, with backup support from us from afar. It\u0026rsquo;s an ambitious goal, but we\u0026rsquo;ll give it a try and see how it goes.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/09/29/frustrating-couple-of-days/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe last few days have been the kind of frustrating IT days you can have anywhere.

I don\u0026rsquo;t DO hot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been nice working here at the EOC. There are interesting people to talk to, when you feel like it. There is hands on work to do out in the community. Today at the feeding center, we had several people come up to us and respond positively to the news that any day now there would be free internet and phone calls where they eat three meals a day. We picked that site because we knew that it would reduce the necessity of marketing; the food brings them in, the free long distance keeps them coming back.\nMy schedule here works like this\u0026hellip; at 6:30 or so our team leader here (Joe) turns on the lights and I get up. I go to breakfast and a morning meeting at 7am to get an assignment for the day. I sometimes get partnered with someone, sometimes I work alone. Depending on the work, I head back to the EOC at lunch for a sack lunch. Today I ate on the run because the network was coming up around lunch and I was too excited to stop and eat. We work until sunset and eat back at the EOC. I spend the evening on \u0026ldquo;office work\u0026rdquo;, then shower and hit the sack. I\u0026rsquo;m working too many hours, but each hour is interesting, so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep at it until there\u0026rsquo;s a reason to change it.\nIt has been hot and humid, but the weather changed a bit as Rita came into the gulf. We started to get some breezes, and the air turned less humid. I think it might be because the wind is coming off the land instead of off the sea, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t taken the time to really check.\nThe National Guard folks are rotating out. Some are coming to replace them, but not as much. Earlier in the week, then it seemed like Rita might come this way, they were packing up pretty fast. That was a little worrying, except that they have so much more crap to move than we do. I can just get in my car and drive north. They have a day of packing to do first.\nToday we got an infusion of fresh blood and brainpower from the folks at SoCalFreenet.org.

I visited Algiers, where this is only wind damage, not flooding damage. I also visited the Central Business District of Nola, which seems to have not flooded either. After finishing my business there Sunday morning I headed down to the French Quarter to be a disaster tourist for a bit. I had set aside Sunday as my day off, and had no other work planned. Joel and I stopped in to this bar that never ever closes. There have been news reports about it. They were getting resupplied, so we helped carry ice upstairs to the ice machine (which, like the rest of the neighboorhood, has no electricity).

He\u0026rsquo;s making a huge mistake, endangering his residents, and doing it in the face of reasoned statistics and arguments from EPA, CDC, and Coast Guard.

I had a safe and comfortable trip from San Pedro to Guatemala City, then on to San Francisco by three American Airlines flights stopping in Dallas and Los Angeles.\nIn Guatemala City, I got to go with Ben, his girlfriend and her brother to the World Cup qualifying game between Guatemala and USA. Ben and Maria had a Guatemala jersey for me to borrow, so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stand out too much as a gringo and get us all killed. They also asked me several times pointedly who I was going to be rooting for. (I assured them Guatemala!) The reason for their concern is that they had bought preferred tickets for the Guatemala section. The stadium is laid out into several sections. The cheap seats are on each end. They go for Q50. Our section was on the sidelines on the far side from the sky boxes and the TV cameras. We paid Q150 ($20) for our seats. There was a tiny section devoted to the visiting team\u0026rsquo;s fans (in this case, about 35 ex-pat Americans, flags waving proudly). All of the sections had huge barbed-wire fences bordering them. The visiting team section also had a line of guards protecting it on each side. Also, there was a huge fence with several layers of barbed wire and concertina wire between the stands and the game. You actually watch the game through chain link fence. There were security guards with riot shields on the edge of the field. There were emergency exits out of the chain link cages we were in but they were chained closed. There was a fireman stationed at every exit who\u0026rsquo;s job was to stand holding the release device on the chain for the entire night.\nOK, with all the scary part out of the way, we can get to the game. It was really fast! Everything moves so much faster in real life than it does on the TV. The ball is tearing around the field, and the tackles are happening at full-out sprint speed. It is 100 times more exciting to watch football in person than on TV.\nDespite a security stance that would have been way more expected in a prison than a sports arena, the crowd was incredibly peaceful. They got really excited and pumped up, and they had the foulest mouths and poorest sportsmanship you could possibly imagine, but their behavior as far as violence was concerned seemed to be above reproach. The poor sportsmanship was only really a one level above the obnoxious behavior that\u0026rsquo;s taken over basketball in the last 20 years. For instance, the crowd made an immense amount of whistling noise whenever the Americans were setting up and making a kick (corner kick, penalty, etc). They also sometimes chanted \u0026ldquo;fags\u0026rdquo;, like when the Americans showed up on the field.\nAs buff as the American football players were, it seemed to me to be a complement to all fags everywhere, but I guess that wasn\u0026rsquo;t what they meant. They used to say I threw like a girl in school, but when I watched my sister Lindsey pitch for her softball team I felt a lot better about my throws!\nThe game itself was great. The teams were agressive, but respected the rules and didn\u0026rsquo;t get hot under the collar. The only yellow card was to a Guatemalan, but even that offence wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad. The officiating seemed pretty fair, though the last time I studied the rules of football, I was still in grade school, so who am I to judge? At least the Guatemalans didn\u0026rsquo;t get too mad at the officials. The teams were well matched, too. The Guatemalans didn\u0026rsquo;t allow the Americans to intimidate them, even though to a man the Guatemalans were shorter than the Americans, sometimes by as much as 8 inches or a foot!\nThere were a number of incredible shots. And as I mentioned before, because everything seems so much faster in real life, it was especially exciting to watch the goal keepers make the saves.\nThe game ended in a tie, 0-0. That was disappointing because Guatemala didn\u0026rsquo;t win (and they really need the points to make it ot Germany). It was also disappointing because I really wanted to experience the feel of the crowd after a goal. I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know anything about the matter, but if I was in charge of FIFA, I would make a rule that all games had to end in an absolute win. But actually, that kind of sucks too, because when you watch a hard fought game go through two overtimes and it is still tied, and it ends up being decided by a penalty shootout, that\u0026rsquo;s a real drag. (Why? Because the emotion is just not there in a penalty goal. Suspense, maybe, but not the genuine mix of surprise and excitement of seeing a goal attempt shoot out of the disorganized mess of attackers and defenders!) It is not so bad watching a 0-0 game for 90 minutes straight, because interesting stuff happens; shots get taken, tackles reverse the balance of the game, penalty shots get taken. But as it comes down to the end, you just dread that there will be no resolution to it. And then the final whistle blows, and it\u0026rsquo;s over, and it all feels like a big waste of time.\nI had a great time, and would recommend to anyone to make sure to catch a World Cup qualifier if you can. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty intimidating mingling with such a big crowd in a big cage, especially when you know that people have died in that very cage at other games. So find a way to have a bunch of locals take you to your first game, like I did! I wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared for a second, but I would have been had I been there alone.\nMy flight home was uneventful, but long. American Airlines flew two out of the three flights at less than 60% capacity. The next time American begs for some more handouts of your tax dollars, call your congressperson and complain. Tell them Jeff says American wasted money and doesn\u0026rsquo;t deserve to be bailed out yet again. On the other hand, though they waste money here and there and whine about it later, at lest they ran all three flights on time, almost to the minute.\nEvery single checked bag at Guatemala City airport gets an extremely thorough hand search. It took forever, but they were very efficient about it. My pack was carefully packed in layer after layer of Guatemalan cloth, so it took the guy forever to dig down through it and then repack it. He did an OK job or repacking it, but it ended up a bit of a mess. I suspect that the TSA has made requirements they have to meet to fly to the US, and as with everything in Guatemala, instead of paying for the expensive machines we use in the states, they just hired and trained a bunch of bag-searching guys.\nThis morning I called up my home chapter of Red Cross and decided with them that it made most sense for me to do my paperwork via the Palo Alto Chapter of the Red Cross. So then I headed in to Palo Alto and turned in my paperwork. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t finished it all the way so I sat in the lobby working on it a bit and also got the lay of the land there. I figured out who was the key person and got her to understand my situation then got her to give me an interview on the spot. That took almost a week delay off the processing time, as they have a backlog of 400 applications that I jumped in front of. One reason I got an interview today is that I am already trained to the level they want me. I \u0026ldquo;passed\u0026rdquo; the interview (I guess\u0026hellip; seemed to me it went OK) and Karl tells me they have already called him for a reference check (of course, he\u0026rsquo;s biased, because he probably just wants me out of his house!) Nonetheless, the next step in the process is next Thursday night, when there is an orientation. Alas, I missed the one they the night I arrived. So between now and Thursday I just have to hang out and find something to occupy myself. As usual, that\u0026rsquo;s not too hard.\nI worked the rest of the afternoon in the Red Cross office at the front desk. I learn fast (and make up what I don\u0026rsquo;t know even faster, a key skill in the Red Cross organization) so I was able to pretty much get a handle on the job in a hurry. The funniest call I got was from a sweet old lady who wanted to donate several jars of coins. I knew damn well that if I let her bring them in on my shift I was just going to get stuck counting them, so I told her about the CoinStar machines in Safeway and asked her to take the coins there first. I also took several people\u0026rsquo;s applications to be deployed. And talked to lots more who wanted to know the status of theirs. A difficult question to answer, so we at the front desk prevailed on the volunteer coordinator to get a list made of the applications she is processing, so that we could at least give them a definitive confirmation that their application is in the queue. They will make up the list over the weekend, and when I go back to work Monday morning in the office, hopefully at least that answer will be easier.\nAlas, the most common call was \u0026ldquo;I have stuff to give you, where do I take it.\u0026rdquo; And the answer has to be the same one I gave the other day here: we can\u0026rsquo;t take stuff, it has to be money. One of the other ladies had someone insistent on the line and eventually came up with the idea that she should hold a garage sale and donate the money. Seemed like a good enough plan, at least good enough to satisfy the caller and get them off the phone.\nWe had a mom bring in two kids who had gathered over $100 doing various things, including a lemonade. I got the executive director to come give them a special thanks, and took a picture of them with my camera phone. I passed it on to the executive director, who will hopefully print it out and post it in the office. The mom commented that she had thought about taking the kids\u0026rsquo; money, writing a check and sending it in. But she decided to have them bring the cash in themselves so they could see with their own eyes what happened to it. A very cool mom.\nI am simultaneously investigating talking with some teams who are deploying wireless internet to Red Cross shelters in northeast Louisiana. I\u0026rsquo;m considering working for them, but the best way for me to do that is probably to drive out there, and the fuel cost will be over $600 for the round trip (I used $4 a gallon as the average price of fuel. It is $3.10 here in the Bay Area, and I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that closer to LA it hits $5). I\u0026rsquo;m still contemplating how to fit that into my increasingly stretched budget, and how the trade off between doing Disaster Services work for the Red Cross versus doing wifi work breaks down. I sense another sleepless night coming on\u0026hellip;\nAt the Palo Alto Chapter, we have had several clients come through. They have made their way here from New Orleans, God alone knows how. I suspect (or at least hope) that they have stopped at Red Cross chapters along the way to get help with the trip. They have relocated themselves to the Bay Area because they have family here. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to talk to any of them because things were so crazy at the desk when they were in. We have two extraordinarily dedicated and expierienced Client Services workers on hand, who did a great job of listening to their story and making a plan for how to help them, now that they are our guests here in the Bay Area.\nThis weekend, Karl and I plan to do some yard work and maybe take a hike. I might work for Red Cross in the office if they get slammed, but right now my next shift is Monday morning.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/09/10/football-in-guatemala-now-back-in-california/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am back home in California.

The reason for their concern is that they had bought preferred tickets for the Guatemala section. The stadium is laid out into several sections. The cheap seats are on each end. They go for Q50. Our section was on the sidelines on the far side from the sky boxes and the TV cameras. We paid Q150 ($20) for our seats. There was a tiny section devoted to the visiting team\u0026rsquo;s fans (in this case, about 35 ex-pat Americans, flags waving proudly). All of the sections had huge barbed-wire fences bordering them. The visiting team section also had a line of guards protecting it on each side. Also, there was a huge fence with several layers of barbed wire and concertina wire between the stands and the game. You actually watch the game through chain link fence. There were security guards with riot shields on the edge of the field. There were emergency exits out of the chain link cages we were in but they were chained closed.

I will meet the director of Planeta en LÃ­nea there. After seeing him and taking in the Guatemala vs. USA World Cup qualifying game (my last entertainment for a while) I will head toward Cancun to catch a flight home to the US. I should arrive in Oakland before 9/15. When I arrive there I will contact my chapter of the American Red Cross, where I was trained in January, and sign up to be sent to the relief operation. I will likely arrive in a wave of volunteers timed to relieve the first wave, who is scheduled to work three weeks. I will work at least three weeks with Red Cross, and probably longer.\nWhat Can I Do?\nIf you are reading this right now and are asking yourself how you can help, I have to respond like all the experts on TV do. Find an organization that you trust to spend your money wisely and give them money. Cold hard cash. Give a bit now, give a bit later when you can afford it again and when the headlines have moved back to Michael Jackson.\nI know it feels better to give time and posessions than it does to give money. Giving of your time is useful, but nothing is more useful than money. The reason is that money moves at the speed of light to the disaster. There are no logisitical nightmares in trying to move money. All money works equally well (as opposed to some foods, which might be inappropriate in the community they reach), it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be cleaned first (like clothes do), and it isn\u0026rsquo;t the wrong kind (like building materials can be).\nUnless you happened to have put in the time beforehand to get the training you need to know how to be helpful, money is the only way you can help. If you hate that answer as much as I did the first time I heard it, then use it as motivation to go down to your Red Cross chapter (or another organization you trust more than the Red Cross, I don\u0026rsquo;t care) and get the training you need before the next hurricane.\nIf you are hell-bent on giving your time (in addition to money), there will be a huge backlog of paperwork to do to keep up with the donations that are arriving right now. It\u0026rsquo;s no fun, and not much of an adventure, but organizations will need ofice workers in droves soon too.\nA Tough Decision\nThis has been a tough decision. About the same time Hurricane Katrina hit, I discovered a volunteering opportunity in New York with MSF that would have been a perfect chance to turn in my application and score some brownie points. Even that opportunity was going to require me to leave Guatemala early, interrupting both my Spanish studies and the term I committed to here.\nI started talking with the director about it, and he gave me \u0026ldquo;permission\u0026rdquo; to leave early. But as the scale of the effects of Katrina on the US grew, I was unsure of the right thing to do. I literally had a half a sleepless night pondering it, and anyone who knows how well I normally sleep should understand how much trouble I was having thinking it over.\nBut the deciding factor was the question I mentioned above. The question boils down to a moral one. I believe I have a responsibility to my local and national community before the wider international community. Normally that responsibility is offset by the relatively small scale of the problems in the United States, and by the energy of my fellow citizens to attack them. But right now, for (hopefully) this one time, that balance is thrown out of whack. The problems the people in the south are facing are so severe that my international plans had to go on hold.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/09/01/katrina-gives-me-a-change-of-plans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOver this year, some people have asked me, \u0026ldquo;Why do you seek to work for an international organization when there are so many problems that need to be solved inside the US?\u0026rdquo; It is a good question, and until Hurricane Katrina, my answer was, \u0026ldquo;I choose to work overseas because the US has enough good people, who can\u0026rsquo;t leave their families and work overseas, and who time and again give their time inside the US.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Katrina Gives me a Change of Plans"},{"content":"Just a quick blog entry so that I don\u0026rsquo;t forget to write down something funny that happened the other day\u0026hellip;\nAt home, I was served a dish which was very close to risotto, one of my favorite dishes of all time.

The good news is I didn\u0026rsquo;t get hurt, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t get very much from me.\nI went for a day trip to Santiago Atitlan yesterday. It is an easy trip; you just take the boat over and back. I was only planning on walking around town, seeing the market, having lunch, and coming home, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t take much with me, not even my backpack. Just my camera in one pocket, and my wallet in the other.\nI had a nice time shopping before lunch. I found some soap that my grandmother asked for, and a cloth bag to carry the soap and other stuff in. I went to a nice place for lunch, and had virtually the same lunch I had several times in Senegal: roasted chicken with carmelized onion sauce. Chickens, charcoal, and onions seem to be some of those universal constants in the kitchen. The other is \u0026ldquo;a small white fish, fried whole and put on a plate\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve had that served to me in two places in Senegal and about 5 places here. For the record, it never really gets easier to politely deal with all the bones. Not my favorite dish, due to the sheer inconvenience of it.\nAfter lunch I decided to take the long way back to the boats to enjoy a little walk and see a bit more of the town. The course I charted for myself was about right\u0026hellip; down through a neighborhood to the fields at the edge of the lake, then follow the lake around to the embarcadero. On my way through the neighborhood, a kid walking towards me tried to snatch my watch off my wrist. The kind of watch band I have ( The Band, from Chisco) does not come off like that, so he didn\u0026rsquo;t get it. I turned around and just watched him walk off, thinking to myself, \u0026ldquo;What a complete asshole.\u0026rdquo; As I turned to keep walking, I made eye contact with a girl who saw it happen and she seemed unsurprised but maybe a bit cognizant of how behavior like this from her neighbors makes people feel about coming to buy things from her.\nI continued my walk, which turned out to be a mistake. Clearly I was outside the allotted zone in Santiago Atitlan \u0026ldquo;Where We Don\u0026rsquo;t Rob Tourists\u0026rdquo;. Alas, on my way out of the fields, about 50 meters from town, I got stopped by two kids. The one in front had a machete, and it was him I concentrated on and dealt with. I suspect the other one was simply along for the ride. The kid in front grabbed my wrist first thing. He never really threatened my physically with the machete, but as he approached to grab my wrist, he showed it to me.\nAfter a tiny struggle where we came to equilibrium, he understanding I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere and wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to resist physically, and I certain I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in any physical danger from a knife. So I looked at him and stupidly and clumsily said, \u0026ldquo;What do you want?\u0026rdquo; As though I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a clue. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but my instinct was to take things slow, to be slow and stupid, and waste his time. It turned out to be a pretty good idea, because he knew he was exposed where we were, and needed to get this transaction over with rapido. He answered, \u0026ldquo;Dinero. Rapido, rapido.\u0026rdquo; Which was fine with me, because I had considered what I\u0026rsquo;d do if I got robbed before, and knew I\u0026rsquo;d happily give them all my money. As a result, I never carry much money. I had about 300 quetzales, or $40 dollars.\nThen something mildly amusing happened. Or at least the only thing amusing I can take away from getting robbed. He was holding my right wrist, tight. As I went to put my right hand in my pocket to get the money it was clear to both of us this wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to work. He seemed unsure what to do about the problem, so I put my other wrist over by his hand for him to take so he could still hold me, but also get his money. As kc says, I need a bumpersticker that says \u0026ldquo;Sysadmins: we fix stuff.\u0026rdquo;\nClearly he hadn\u0026rsquo;t done this much before. Of course, he looked to be only 15 years old or so, so he hadn\u0026rsquo;t much time to practice.\nSo I get out my wallet and pull out all the money and give it to him. He wanted the wallet, but I told him, no, take the money (which was a pointless argument because there was nothing else in the wallet; my cards, passport, etc live other places). Somewhere along the line, he grabbed the gold chain I wear, which was a present from kc. That really pissed me off, but I was too busy dealing with the money and his other demands to do anything about it. I really regret now that I didn\u0026rsquo;t figure out a way to trade him the money for the chain\u0026hellip; it was worth much more to me than to him, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure the time it would have taken to argue about this would have been all good for me and all bad for him.\nThen he asked for my camera. It was put away in my pocket and I was certain he had not seen it yet. So I said that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have one. This was a bit more of a risk than I should have taken, because (1) it is insured, and (2) it\u0026rsquo;s unclear how things would have worked out if he\u0026rsquo;d found the camera afterall. Again though, I was helped by the fact we were in broad daylight on a trail with a lot of traffic, he was in a huge hurry, and I was under no real physical threat. So after asking a few more times, tugging fruitlessly at my watch and my new bag securely on my shoulder, they gave up and took off. I watched them head on down the trail to see if any witnesses would show up, but alas no one did.\nI walked up the trail and asked the people sitting on a doorstep if they knew the two kids that walked by. Without a beat they said, \u0026ldquo;Did they rob you?\u0026rdquo; So clearly they either knew the kids or knew their reputation. I told them yes, and they asked how much I lost. I told them only 300 quetzales, and they said, \u0026ldquo;No we don\u0026rsquo;t know them. Nope.\u0026rdquo; Which I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure was a lie. I think they were just calculating the various costs/benefits of turning them in. Probably they needed to know how much I lost to calculate the kickback they would be getting from the thiefs. But I was in a pretty dark mood then, and perhaps they were just telling the truth. But I doubt it.\nSo lessons\u0026hellip; Don\u0026rsquo;t keep walking in a neighboorhood after the first robbery attempt, no matter how fleeting. Continue not carrying much cash. And, if time is on your side (it is daylight, you can expect other foot traffic), and you are not actively being threatened with harm, take your time and waste theirs. The sooner they give up and take off, the less you lose.\nOh, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t report it to the police. The travel insurance I have does not cover cash, only stuff. So it would have just been a waste of time, and contrary to one of the cardinal rules of travel in Guatemala: the less you have to do with the police the better. Yes, even walking into a police station to report a robbery is, alas, breaking that rule. It is not inconcieveable that you could walk in to the police and end up set up for some other crime! Oversight from the capital is apparently not a top priority for the police.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/08/22/robbed-in-santiago-atitlan/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, it had to happen sooner or later.

I was only planning on walking around town, seeing the market, having lunch, and coming home, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t take much with me, not even my backpack. Just my camera in one pocket, and my wallet in the other.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Robbed in Santiago Atitlan"},{"content":"This weekend one of Paulina\u0026rsquo;s daughters (Paulina is mi abuela or grandmother, here) flew to Canada for a 4 month internship. She will be working with a program in Saskatchewan that provides services to rural communities. She\u0026rsquo;s pretty good at English (about as good as I am at Spanish, I guess), but she\u0026rsquo;ll be getting quite a lot more practice in Canada, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure! She will be in Vancouver the first week for some kind of orientation, then she will move to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan for the duration of her visit.\nShe normally lives and studies in Xela. She\u0026rsquo;s one of several kids Paulina has in Xela. Last time I was here I noticed her making way more tortillas than even I eat and asked why. Turns out once a week she sends a batch of tortillas to Xela on a chicken bus unattended. At the other end, one of the kids picks up the tortillas and distributes them. She says she does it because corn is cheaper here in San Pedro. Also, I suspect it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of time, and motherly love. She\u0026rsquo;s got the time to do the work here, and her kids don\u0026rsquo;t (so the would have to eat machine made tortillas, which are more expensive since you have to pay for the shop, the equipment, the labor, the profit, etc).\nFinally, in Latin American cultures, it\u0026rsquo;s always worth considering the gender aspect. At least one of her children in Xela is a man, and men don\u0026rsquo;t cook. In fact, when I express interest in what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the kitchen the women here are a little surprised (but not too much, as they have had gringos living with them for years now). Time and again I wonder what life would be like here if I were a woman traveler. I suspect there are some walls between me and the mothers who feed me that would fall away after a bit.\nThis is the first person in the family to travel outside of Central America. In honor of her trip, the entire family traveled with her to Guatemala City to send her off. They all got up at 2 am this morning and took the bus in, then returned this afternoon. I think there were at least 6 people traveling with her to the Guatemala airport.\nIt was heartwarming to see the same kind of excitement, sadness, and fear before a big trip in this family that I see in my own. Paulina washed her daughter\u0026rsquo;s backpack for her (just like my Mom helped me do earlier this year!) and all the women worked together in the kitchen preparing snacks to take on the bus with them.\nAfter dinner tonight, Paulina asked me, \u0026ldquo;Are the taxi drivers in Canada dangerous?\u0026rdquo; She was worried because with layovers and whatnot, her daughter will not arrive in Vancouver until 8 pm. Arriving in a strange city at 8 pm in Guatemala is a big no-no. When I am traveling here, I always aim to be indoors in a safe place (like my hotel or family) by sunset. Once I know a city a bit more, I may stay out after dark, but only after getting a feel for it during the day. So, you can understand this Guatemalan mother\u0026rsquo;s concern. I reassured her that Canada is a much safer country than Guatemala is, and that in particular the taxis are safe.\nThe other thing Paulina probably does not know about Canada is how long the summer days are up there. Something that I really miss about summer in the tropics is that the days are still about 12 hours long, instead of the amazing 16 hour days we get up north. According to TimeAndDate.com sunset comes at 8:15 pm this time of year in Vancouver, whereas it comes at 6 pm down here.\nIt has been much rainer recently. Towards the end of the week the weather changed from spring-like days with afternoon and evening thunderstorms to slow, consistent rain with short breaks of clouds but no rain. At least the mornings start out nice, but that can be a problem because it is easy to get caught out with shorts and no jacket as the rain starts for another 12 hours. It was quite cold this evening, as a result of the afternoon of rain. When I got back to my room the first thing I did was put on some socks! Tomorrow I think I will leave the house wearing my boots instead of my sandals.\nI was hoping to go to Santiago Atitlan this weekend for a day trip, but I stayed indoors today instead. Perhaps tomorrow will be better weather, and I can go then.\nWhoa! As I was writing this a giant green cricket-like thing came flying in my room and landed on the wall, narrowly missing my head. I got Paulina to show her, and she said \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Delores.\u0026rdquo; As I stood there, stunned, trying to understand how it was that I had lived in this house almost a month and not met the family pet, Delores the Cricket, she clarified: \u0026ldquo;In Tz\u0026rsquo;utujil, it\u0026rsquo;s called a delores\u0026rdquo;. (I suspect I have the spelling wrong on the Mayan word for cricket, but it sure sounded like Delores.) I explained why I was confused, and they thought it was pretty funny.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/08/22/big-news-in-the-family/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis weekend one of Paulina\u0026rsquo;s daughters (Paulina is \u003cem\u003emi abuela\u003c/em\u003e or grandmother, here) flew to Canada for a 4 month internship.

I was going to move in with them when they got a bed for their spare room, but they couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a convenient one to borrow or buy. So, after a week in the hotel, I found the family I lived with before at the top of the hill and asked them for a room. They were delighted to have me back with them.\nI live with Familia Bixchul, including Paula (the grandmother), Gloria (the mom), Juan Diego (Gloria\u0026rsquo;s son), and Jennifer (Juan\u0026rsquo;s sister). Both Paula and Gloria have husbands who live in the house, but for some reason our schedules never overlap, so I really don\u0026rsquo;t know them at all. It\u0026rsquo;s like this in Guatemalan families I\u0026rsquo;ve observed: the extended family lives together, but people come and go on their own schedule. The food is all the kind that tastes fine if it\u0026rsquo;s been sitting on the stove a while, so when you are ready for a meal, you just present yourself to Paula, and eat with whoever else it already there.\nSpeaking of whoever else, this week we had two guys from the United States staying with us. The maximum gringo capacity of this house is 3, which suits me fine. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to have some company from time to time, and also nice not to be overrun by english speakers.\nAs I mentioned before, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much impossible to sleep in Guatemala after about 6 am. The roosters start at 4:30 am, the mill starts at 5:30, and by 6 am, the neighbors all have their radios on at top volume. After all, if your neighbor\u0026rsquo;s marimba music is at top volume, how else will you be able to hear your evangelical choir other than to play it at top volume? It sort of makes sense, if you think about it. And believe me, every morning I lay in bed thinking about it\u0026hellip;\nSo I get up at 6:30 am or so and have a shower. I\u0026rsquo;ve long since gotten used to the aqua-death-machine that Guatemalans call a shower and hardly flinch when the lights dim, in a great approximation of the effect they use in the electric chair scenes in movies. In case I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention it before, it\u0026rsquo;s an electric showerhead. Remember how when you were a kid your parents taught you that electricty + bath = death? Turns out they what they meant was, \u0026ldquo;Electricty + bath = death, but not if you\u0026rsquo;re in Guatemala\u0026rdquo;. I cannot explain it, but somehow I have not yet been killed by the electric showerhead. I fully expect to tomorrow, as I do every morning.\nOk, I\u0026rsquo;ll stop being a joker for a second. What I\u0026rsquo;m talking about is a just-in-time water heater. We have them in the US too, for making our tea. How bourgeois. The reason I call them aqua-death-machines is that instead of being mounted under a counter, where you can pretend that water is not being mixed with electricity to make your tea, the actual showerhead is the heater. And there\u0026rsquo;s a pair of wires leading from the showerhead to the wall. Usually, in lieu of wire nuts, the wires are twisted together and have some electrical tape on them. The electrical tape is usually peeling off, as it does. And all this is suspended somewhat precariously above you.\nSo anyway\u0026hellip; I survive my nice comfortable shower, and head up for breakfast. It\u0026rsquo;s two pancakes and atol (which is like cream of wheat, or oatmeal, or mashed plantains). Mi abuela remembered that I can\u0026rsquo;t eat three pancakes, how cool is that? I go back downstairs and kill time for a while, studying Spanish or reading (in English so far, though I hope to read a few Spanish books while I am here).\nI head in to work at 8:30 or so. Earlier this week I was arriving before everyone else, so I gave up and am arriving closer to 9 am now. I sit down and like all computer workers everywhere, commence staring at the computer for several hours. What I\u0026rsquo;m doing during that time is working on two software projects that I think Planeta en LÃ­nea could use. For both of them, I am also concentrating on how I can make them useful to the wider community. Afterall, there\u0026rsquo;s no sense having my work be stuck here at this one site.\nFor the techies out there, the two projects are related to network monitoring and DNS. No big surprise there. If the DNS thing turns out like I hope, it might be the kind of thing you\u0026rsquo;ll want to use in the little Internet Cafe that is your home network. If I don\u0026rsquo;t announce anything, it\u0026rsquo;s been a spectacular failure. Feel free to ridicule me for announcing vaporware.\nOne thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is how inconvient it is to live your digital life in a language other then English. How many of you out there knew that Putty has a UTF-8 mode, and that it is not the default? How many of you knew that if you only set the LANG variable to \u0026ldquo;es\u0026rdquo;, Unix does The Wrong Thing. You have to tell it which Spanish you want. Guatemalan is \u0026ldquo;es_GT.UTF-8\u0026rdquo;. For the record, Windows does this all much, much closer to right than Unix. But take a look at the first three bytes of a file saved as UTF-8 in notepad.exe sometime. (Have a vomit bag handy.)\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not hacking code, I hang out downstairs in the Internet Cafe, poking at the machines and thinking about how I might make the administration of them better. Because Planeta en LÃ­nea is already doing a fantastic job, it\u0026rsquo;s tricky to figure out where I can be helpful instead of just an annoying gringo with Big Ideas. The last thing I want is to leave behind things that are a burden to maintain.\nJuan and I also have been working on parts of the network, to make the wifi distribution more solid and to find and fix problems. Juan is a pretty good troubleshooter, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have much to teach. Mostly I learn Spanish as I try to explain an idea for a test I have, only to find out that\u0026rsquo;s precisely what Juan is already doing. \u0026ldquo;Ya hago,\u0026rdquo; dice con una sonrisa. Doh.\nLunch is at 12:30 or so. I trudge up the hill and eat, then hang out for a while, sometimes even sneaking a siesta in (but not often). Juan and I start work again at 2 pm. We usually have a Photoshop lesson then, but some days things come up and we don\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nMonday, Wednesday and Friday I have Spanish lessons from 3 pm until 6 pm. My teacher is Jose from the same school I studied at before. He\u0026rsquo;s patient, and does a good job of mixing conversation and exercises. I have to be pretty clear about what I want him to teach me, instead of just waiting for the lessons to come. Left to his own devices, I think he\u0026rsquo;d be happy to only use conversation to teach me. Alas, I know that when I am corrected in the middle of a conversation the lesson goes in one ear and out the other. I have to learn by reading, and preferably by writing. Jose now knows that, and we are coming to a workable system. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll probably stick with him for many more weeks, possibly as long as I am here.\nDinner is around 6:30 pm. It is every day, without fail, eggs and beans (and the ubiquitous tortillas). Which is no big deal, I like eggs and beans. But 7 days out of 7 is a few too many. So I warned my family when I moved in that they should expect that 2 or 3 days a week I would eat dinner on my own in the gringo establishments down the hill. That helps me keep my sanity, and I meet interesting people too. Last night I met a pair of precocious sisters and a very proud dad. He\u0026rsquo;s brought them to San Pedro two summers in a row to help them master Spanish.\nOn the weekends I plan an outting for myself. Last weekend I went to the market at Chichicastenango. It was moderately interesting, but really not much different than any other market I\u0026rsquo;ve been to here. It is mostly an example of travel book hype. Sometimes you wonder if the travel book writers are actually all located in New York, and just take what other people said and fluff it up. I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that the infinite cycle of plagarism and fluffery results in things like the market at Chichi.\nTomorrow, I am going to take a hike up to the top of a nearby mountain. I managed to join up with some Aussies who arranged it. They are a really nice couple, just finished working 2 years in a health clinic in the outback. They are now blowing the money they couldn\u0026rsquo;t spend on anything in that small-town life on 12 months traveling from Mexico to Patagonia (or until the money runs out, whichever comes first).\nIn case it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear (after the hyperbole about the aqua-death-machines) I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy here. This is exactly what I envisioned for myself for this time. It remains to be seen how helpful I can really be to Planeta en LÃ­nea, but I can tell that this time is going to be useful to me!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/08/12/a-day-in-my-life-in-san-pedro/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been working here in San Pedro for two weeks now, and I owe people an update on what I\u0026rsquo;m up to here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first week, I slept in a hotel and ate at the house of my coworker\u0026rsquo;s parents.

This week Hank, the father, died of heart failure. It was a big shock to such a little community, and he will be missed. His son has a good support network here, so hopefully he will find the strength to get sorted out in his new life alone (his mother is also dead).\nI felt a bit of connection to the family because when I arrived in San Pedro the first time, I was late to meet my contact at the Casa Rosario Spanish school. I needed to make a phone call and Mark, Hank\u0026rsquo;s son, let me make a call from the hotel desk. Later that week I met Hank in the Buddah Bar and was inspired by the story of how he and his son came together to San Pedro to open this hotel together.\nThis afternoon, the funeral procession passed by the office where I am working, so I joined it. Locals and gringos were carrying Hank\u0026rsquo;s coffin through the streets from Jarachik, where it had been for the wake, to the cemetary which is at the top of the hill. It was a long way to go with a heavy casket, but the men took turns carrying it, and we got it there safely. I was honored to be asked to take my turn to get Hank safely up the hill, through the winding streets of San Pedro.\nAt the cemetary, several people made some little speeches in Spanish, then they slid the coffin into an above-ground crypt. A bricklayer was on hand with cement, ready to wall up the front of it.\nA couple memories stand out from the experience. First, because gringos are in general much taller than local men, there was some difficulty carrying the coffin. After a few changes resulting in too much weight on the tall people, people got the idea and sorted themselves into altos y pequeÃ±os. ( Soy un pequeÃ±o.) Later when it came time to lift the coffin way up into the air to put it into the crypt, the call came from somewhere in the crowd, Â¡Altos, por favor!\nAnother memory is of the bricklayer, who was standing up on the crypt structure to help get the coffin in. Once it was in as far as los altos could push with their hands, he slid it home by giving it a gentle shove with his foot. It struck me immediately as disrespectful, then immediately again as pure Guatemala: when there\u0026rsquo;s something heavy to be moved here, people work together, and they work hard. Basically the only tool they use is their bodies, and they get the job done neatly, simply and efficiently. Lest I paint the bricklayer as some brute, I should point out that his next action was to take boquets of flowers from the women in the crowd and neatly arrange them in front of the coffin. Finally, he started measuring up the wall he was about to build at the front of the crypt. I look forward to seeing how Mark\u0026rsquo;s friends help him decorate the front of the crypt.\nIt was a great experience. Somber, of course. But I also felt honored to be able to pop out of my doorway and walk along with Hank as he took his last trip through the streets of San Pedro, a city he loved enough to come back to again and again until he lived here.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/08/11/un-entierro-guatemalteco/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJarachik, one of the restaurants/hotels in town is owned by a father and son team from Holland.

Who knew?\nI was feeling pretty smug in Cancun, with my ticket bought, plenty of time to go around and get dinner, then shop for snacks on the bus, use the Internet, etc. Only problem was my watch was two timezones wrong, so I had two less hours than I thought. I feel so dumb now, because there were three things that should have tipped me off. First, the clock in the bus terminal. I ignored it because Mexican clocks are always about 2 hours off. It turns out the clocks that taught me the \u0026ldquo;always ignore the clocks in Mexico\u0026rdquo; rule were the ones in the Metro, where the time of day has little to do with getting a train. In a Mexican bus station, the clocks are right. In fact, they are right to the second, like in a Swiss train station!\nThe other two things that should have tipped me off was that the sun set suspiciously early, but I wrote that off to being at 16 degrees north latitude. Finally, I ordered a special menu item that was only available until 6 pm. The waiter said, no, can\u0026rsquo;t have it. I figured they were out of it, because, hey, it\u0026rsquo;s only 5pm. Sigh.\nAnyway, after missing the bus things seemed hopeless. Getting the ticket changed cost a 50% surcharge. I was out of money becuase I hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to have to buy an extra half a bus ticket, nor stay the night in Cancun. I go to the ATM, but with my transaction it realizes, \u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;m actually out of order, sorry for confusing you by the big ABIERTO sigh.\u0026rdquo; And in doing so it takes enough time to return my card that I become convinced it\u0026rsquo;s just eaten it. But eventually the card comes out, but I don\u0026rsquo;t get any money. So I figure, to hell with it, I\u0026rsquo;ll solve the money problem in the morning. I knew I had enough money for a hotel (and hotels take US dollars, so my \u0026ldquo;get out of trouble\u0026rdquo; money would have worked too).\nI get to my hotel and just relax on the bed. I fell asleep at 10 pm (real local time). God only knows what time is was in California at 10 pm in Cancun\u0026hellip; I never did get a straight answer from anyone about what timezone Cancun was in.\nThe next day everything went fine. I took a walk and explored Cancun. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to make it out to the hotel zone where all the people who want to pretend they are still in the US are. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really very motivated to anyway. I got on my bus at 14:15 and settled in. I had a baby near me, but it was OK. The seat next to me was empty, so I had a little nest of all my food, books, computer, etc to keep me occupied. I saw a nifty movie about a Australian brothers who were swimmers and their unhealthy relationship with their father. The sound is in English but the subtitles are in Spanish. The sound isn\u0026rsquo;t really loud enough, so you really have to concentrate and read the Spanish. When you miss a bit of Spanish hopefully the audio was loud enough that you can learn the word you missed. Not the best environment for studying, but I could tell I got a little bit of practice.\nOne other interesting thing about the bus ride was that it swung south before heading west. That took us through the hurricane damaged areas from Hurricane Emily. It was very interesting to see the damage. From the road, it appeared that mostly it was damage to trees and power lines. I saw a couple thatch roofs that had been taken off. I think I got a really good picture of the damage from the bus window, but you know how pictures from buses are.\nThis morning I got in to San Cristobal a little after 8 am. Of course, the bus to Panajachel leaves at 8 am, so I have to spend the night here too. I suspected that might be the case, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bug me. I went to see the amber museum today, and a church on a hill. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to get some people together from the hostel and go to the circus tonight at 6:30 or 8:30. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to be in a city you know again. I went straight to the same hostel as last time, and knew exactly which attractions I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to see last time.\nAssuming I get my bus tomorrow morning, I\u0026rsquo;ll be in Panajachel at 2 pm, then I\u0026rsquo;ll take the boat across to San Pedro. Sunday night is a hard time to find a family to stay with, so I will get a hotel there too, I think.\nOne more piece of good news. My brand new fancy (and expensive) digital camera works really well, and lives comfortably in my pocket. As a result, I am taking way, way more pictures. Jessica, you\u0026rsquo;re really going to have to find some billable hours to help me pay for this thing! For those that care about such things, it is a Sony T7 Karl took me to Sony Style to get.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/07/30/in-san-cristobal/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, it turns out things don\u0026rsquo;t go like you planned when you travel.

Quickly MSF-Belgium\u0026rsquo;s differing interpretation of the mission angered MSF-France, so much so that MSF-France attempted to strip MSF-Belgium of the MSF name in 1985. They failed. The 5 current operational sections used to be 6: MSF-Greece was created to be operational. However, in 1999 MSF-Greece was expelled from the MSF movement over its stance on intervention in Kosovo. It has been reintegrated into the MSF movement as of early 2005, but its operations are now done under the authority of MSF-Spain. Government funding dropped from 50% in 1999 to 20% in 2003. That was due to the increased private-donor fundraising power of the new sections (Australia, Japan, USA, etc). MSF-France relies on MSF-USA for close to 40% of it\u0026rsquo;s operational funds. MSF-Holland has only 20% Dutch citizens in the field. They rely on other sections to make up the other 80%. Internal controls meant to ensure external communications are consistent and do not jeopardize any operations are sometimes (perhaps routinely?) ignored in order to prevent the consultation and coordination process from watering down the message. None of that really changes my desire to work for MSF, but it does explain where some of the friction I\u0026rsquo;ve heard returned volunteers talk about comes from. One volunteer told me that it\u0026rsquo;s not true that MSF doesn\u0026rsquo;t play well with other NGO\u0026rsquo;s.

They know about these seats so late, they cannot offer any kind of reservation system for them. They let third-parties sell vouchers to get people onto the planes, but the airlines don\u0026rsquo;t want the third parties competeing with them, so the third parties are prohibited from advertising. So there\u0026rsquo;s this little micro-industry of people who sell these vouchers, and you basically have to hear about it from someone who has done it to know about it. It\u0026rsquo;s called air-hitching, or standby travel. I heard about it from Erika of Pangaea.\nAs an adventure, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to fly back to Guatemala by air hitching. I will spend about 50% of the best possible price of a commercial flight for the vouchers, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll spend some more money for ground transport. I\u0026rsquo;ll be going from Oakland to Cancun, which is the only route that is \u0026ldquo;air hitchable\u0026rdquo; and gets me close to where I want to be. I\u0026rsquo;ll travel from Cancun to Lake Atitlan for about 20% of the price of the commercial flight. That leaves me with a 30% margin to come out ahead. I suspect I\u0026rsquo;ll end up eating all that margin up with some sort of snafu. Should be interesting.\nThe first step of my air-hitching experience was getting to the bottom of the feuds happening in the industry so as to pick a company with the least bad reputation. It is a tiny industry which seems to be populated by blowhards, shady characters, and overzealous, immature, rude students. You really can\u0026rsquo;t make this stuff up\u0026hellip; for a bit of background about the players, read this. I decided to go with AirTech, which seems to have the least public dirt on it on the net. (Until now\u0026hellip; read on.)\nI got ready to buy my voucher, but the only delivery option was $14 for 1-day delivery in the United States. I didn\u0026rsquo;t need it this fast, so I sent this email to find out if there was an alternative:\nTo: fly@airtech.com Date: Jun 18, 2005 2:05 AM The only shipping option I see is 1-day, at $14. First, that\u0026#39;s $6 more than 1 day shipping from USPS costs. Second, I don\u0026#39;t need the vouchers until 7/14. You are already $30 more expensive than air-hitch.org. The $14 extra is too much. Can you ship them with only certified mail ($3) or will I need to buy from air-hitch.org? -jeff I will fully, gleefully admit that I was playing the finicky customer. I fully expected I was going to get stuck with the $14, but I figured it didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to ask. I also wanted to try out their e-mail responsiveness before I gave them my money, and this was as good a question as any. They advertise low prices for the vouchers, so it is natural that they would try to rip you off by quoting unreasonably high prices for the shipping. That said, the vouchers are like cash, so they need to be shipped with at least certified mail. So $5 might have been fair. $14 has clearly got a little profit in it.\nPromptly, I got the following note back:\nFrom: mike Date: Jun 18, 2005 2:12 AM Hi Jeff, It is a bit expensive but I guarantee you that if you deal with us you will have first rate service and a much better experience in general.. for the additonal 30 dollars (and btw I don\u0026#39;t think you have added up all of airhitches charges) you will at least be able to deal with a professional and courteous organisation that takes fone calls and returns calls, air hitch does not have fone service nor do they return calls, I also advise you to search the internet and see the huge amount of negative opinions that people have about air-hitch, but don\u0026#39;t see you haven\u0026#39;t been warned, also..what was your itinerary where are you trying to get to? Good luck! Michael Esterson President, Airtech www.airtech.com PS you can save the shipping charge by picking up your flight passes in NYC.. A couple things to notice about this message:\nThe president of the company is doing customer service. Have I mentioned this is a tiny little fragment of the travel industry? The attention to detail in the response is somewhat below that you might expect for a professional customer service agent. My question was not answered, but he offered a way to avoid the charge entirely. OK, not perfect, but it\u0026rsquo;s a start. The response consists of about 2 lines promoting his company, and 7 lines tearing down the competitor. Irritated that my experience air hitching was going down the exact same path that so many have suffered before, I replied:\nTo: mike Date: Jun 18, 2005 2:52 AM Thank you for the warning, but I am fully aware of the history of the three feuding companies. Instead of insulting your competitor, could you please answer my question: Is there a cheaper shipping option than $14? The answer to your question is that I would like to fly from Oakland CA to Cancun Mexico around 7/15/05 and return roughly 2 months later. It is this unprofessional behavior that makes all three of you bozos (AirTech, Air-Hitch, and AirHitch) hardly worth dealing with. -jeff Note that I managed to write three professional sentences and then let loose with the last one. This was a combination old-style flaming (pissed off writers write rude things), but also a test to see if I could get the info I needed and get back to doing business with AirTech without resorting to calling each other names. Yes, I called them bozos. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s not a very nice thing to do. But I\u0026rsquo;m the customer and if he wants my money, it is really a small price to pay to suck it up, ignore the insult, and get back to business.\nThe reply followed the pattern of AirHitch so closely, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if the two companies really did go their separate ways! Here it is:\nFrom: mike Date: Jun 18, 2005 3:02 AM I was trying to answer you in a thoughtful way, you answered in a mean and aggressive way, mean spirited customers like you are hardly worth dealing with, take your business where you please, I am sure in this case either company will work fine for you, may your journey be a safe one. And the answer is no, there is no other option than the $14 dollar shipping fee that we charge. Peace mike Wow, OK, so now who\u0026rsquo;s flaming? I think this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been explicitly fired as a customer by a company (let alone, by their president). The really sick thing is, though, that I still want to do business with them. Because here\u0026rsquo;s the really ugly truth about air hitching: this kind of service is about the best you can hope for. If you think air hitching is for you (financially, or for the simple adventure of it), you simply have to tolerate this type of behavior from the companies. Strange, huh?\nI just replied to him as follows:\nTo: mike Date: Jun 18, 2005 4:21 AM \u0026gt; answer is no, there is no other option than the $14 dollar \u0026gt; shipping fee that Thank you, that\u0026#39;s the piece of info I needed, which I could not find for myself on your website. If you will take my business I\u0026#39;d like to give it to you. I would like to try standby travel for the first time, and my research leads me to believe you guys will give me the best service in the industry. So, should I click buy, or would prefer I didn\u0026#39;t? -jeff It will be interesting to see if his greed overcomes his desire to inflict the maximum damage upon me possible, which I assume would be him blacklisting me from ever travelling with them or something. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of hoping he does, so I can just give up on this air hitching thing before it gets any uglier than it already is!\nBut for now, I will persevere, so that I have something to write about here.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/06/17/air-hitching/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen an airplane is about to leave, and there\u0026rsquo;s still room on it (taking into consideration pre-planned, unchangeable limits, like \u0026ldquo;we only put in enough fuel for 170 people\u0026rdquo;) there are sometimes seats the airline would still like to fill, if they could get some money for them.

I have been having a nice time here, and so I\u0026rsquo;ve postponed and delayed and conveniently forgotten to write anything down about my time here until the absolute last second. Which is now.\nI have been meaning to write in Spanish, to keep from losing what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so far. But that takes a long time and there always seems to be something more interesting to do. At least some of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing here are preparatory study for my RedR class next week, so it\u0026rsquo;s not like I have been completely slacking off.\nI got here last Friday. Sima met me at the airport, which was cool because we didn\u0026rsquo;t actually have a plan for how to meet, and my e-mail was bouncing in such a way that Sima couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure I was getting her mail to me. (Fixed. Thanks Karl!) We went shopping for a work party, then I hung out on my own until evening, then joined Sima at work for a showing of Office Space.\nOn the weekend, we went to Yvoire, a little touristy city in France, on the shore of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva, in English). It somehow had this deeply artificial feeling to it. Like Disneyland, but without a central control mechanism. Strange feeling. It was a pleasant place to spend the day, but it would have been horrible with huge crowds.\nThe best part of the day, by far, was riding home on the ferry. We were using the Lake Geneva ferries, which are run by the Swiss Fedral train service. On the way out we got a modern diesel ferry. It had incredible horsepower, which might have just been because the Swiss never engineer anything without overengineering it, or it might have been because the current in Lake Geneva is ferocious. The lake is actually a wide spot in the mighty river Rhone. But I digress. Because as cool as riding upstream in a hot-rod ferry was, riding downstream in a steam-powered paddler wheeler was even cooler!\nThe best thing was that there was a gallery looking down into the engine room, so you could see the two huge pistons running the paddlewheels. Like the diesel boat, the steam powered one had a huge amount of power. The captain would bring it screaming in alongside the dock, and you\u0026rsquo;d think \u0026ldquo;Oh man, he\u0026rsquo;s really done it now, he\u0026rsquo;ll never get the boat stopped in time!\u0026rdquo;. But he\u0026rsquo;d ring down to the engineer \u0026ldquo;full speed reverse\u0026rdquo; and the paddle wheels would churn, the whole boat shuddering, and the boat would stop on a dime. I suspect this paddleboat driving style is a uniquely Swiss technique.\nThe last time I was here, I took a bunch of train rides around Switzerland with Steve and Sima. I watched time and again to see what the largest deviation from the schedule was. The largest was perhaps 35 seconds or so. But out of 10 trips, all the rest were closer to 5-10 seconds \u0026ldquo;late\u0026rdquo;. Of course, with that level of punctuality, it is simply possible the engineer\u0026rsquo;s watch was 5 seconds behind the station clock! (And how could I measure to the second? Station clocks in Swizterland all have second hands. Try to find a second hand on a clock in an American airport sometime!)\nAnyway, I suspect the crisp docking and undocking manuevers the Swiss ferries do comes from the same place deep in the Swiss psyche as the on-time train departures, measured in seconds.\nOn Monday I planned a bicycle trip with great help from Sima. The plan was to cross the SalÃ¨ve via the TÃ©lÃ©phÃ©rique, then ride down the back side on sloping farmland to La Roche sur Foron. I\u0026rsquo;d spend the night someplace in La Roche, and then ride down to Annecy the next day. At Annecy, I\u0026rsquo;d stay in a youth hostel a night, then do a ride on the lake front. Finally, I\u0026rsquo;d take the bus home to Geneva, stowing the bike underneath.\nOn my way in to la Roche, I saw a water-wheel spinning on the side of a mill. I stopped to take a look, but the hours on the bulding claimed it was closed. But I noticed a worker guy was downstairs tending to the mill, and so I parked my bike and went down to see him. I told him \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m an engineer, and your mill is very interesting\u0026rdquo;, and he invited me in for a tour. How cool! It used a clever little device to auto-feed the grain, and a nifty sorter that separated the flour into fine, course, and wheat germ buckets. Then he took me down into the basement, with a cobweb-encrousted ceiling about 3 feet tall. We duckwalked around looking at the transmission that moved the power up to the mill. He also had a sawmill with a giant reciprocating blade (like a jigsaw). Because there was not much water, he was running the mill with about 80% electric power, and 20% hydro. He has a hydro turbine though, so when there is enough water, he can be totally self-sufficient. The neatest thing was the bearing holding the axle of the waterwheel. It was a river rock set in concrete, with a half-moon shaped notch carved in it. The axle simply sat in the notch, and spun on a film of oil. It reminded me of what I learned of how railroad bearings used to work at the Golden Gate Railroad museum.\nIn la Roche, I ended up staying in Le Clos du Bout du Pont which was a great little bed and breakfast. The lady there spoke only French, and my tiny amount of French had been obliterated by my Spanish. In the morning, over breakfast, she helped me plan my route to Annecy. With a map and fingers to point with, no words are really necessary.\nI ended up following the plan as far as Annecey, but I decided I\u0026rsquo;d had enough pretty countryside and a sore enough bottom that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to stay the night in Annecy and ride more the next day. So I took the bus home a day early. Sima didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to care one way or another, and I figured rent is cheaper at her house than at the hostel in Annecy.\nSince I imposed myself for quite a long time on poor Sima, I am trying my best to pay \u0026ldquo;rent\u0026rdquo;. One of her computers died, so I rode the bike she loaned me to a computer store and got her a disk, then installed it and reinstalled Windows. I also have been doing the shopping for her, and helping with the cooking.\nSima and I like cooking together. She\u0026rsquo;s one of the first friends that I regularly cooked with, back in Montreal, and we still enjoy it. We\u0026rsquo;ve cooked french toast, spanikopita, several pasta dishes, and enjoyed various \u0026ldquo;picnic\u0026rdquo; dinners when we were not hungry enough for anything other than cheese and bread. We also have had fresh fruit and chocolate a few times for desert. Sima is in charge of the wine, as it is her cellar and she knows it best. Sometimes I pop the cork for her, but otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s all her job.\nLast night, Sima and I made a pasta dish that was so good, we decided to write it down. It it really fun cooking improvisationally with someone else. Especially Sima, who thinks and cooks very much like I do. So, here\u0026rsquo;s what we made:\nJeff and Sima\u0026rsquo;s Run-of-the-mill Veggie Pasta\nMakes about 3 servings.\nPasta and vegetable chunks (1) 250 grams rotini 1 small zucchini 8 button mushrooms (called \u0026ldquo;champignon Parisien\u0026rdquo; ici) 1.5 small onions 2 tablespoons capers oil 1/4 cup white wine\nRoast Veggies (2) 2/3 of a large bell pepper, chopped (we used some leftover green and red pepper, totalling about 2/3 of a pepper) 7 cloves garlic, chopped in half canola oil truffle oil\nRest of sauce (3) 8 sun-dried tomato halves, rehydrated in hot water a \u0026ldquo;bunch\u0026rdquo; of basil (but save some for garnishing) 1/2 cup vegetable broth 1/3 cup parmesian, grated \u0026ldquo;lots\u0026rdquo; of fresh ground black pepper \u0026ldquo;dribble\u0026rdquo; of truffle oil\nCook pasta, drain. Stir fry onions in oil. Add zucchini, cook covered. Add mushrooms and wine. Cook covered. Add pasta and capers, and remove from heat. Add sauce (below), mix and serve.\nFor the sauce, roast the veges (2) for about 10 minutes. Not fully roasted, just enough to mellow the flavors a bit. Add in rest of sauce ingredients (3). Blend with a blender, food processor, or whatever.\nFor some ingredients, you can tell who added them by the measurements: metric or standard. I may know how long a kilometer is, but I still can\u0026rsquo;t cook in metric!\nWith two days left in Geneva, I realized I should get busy seeing some tourist stuff I\u0026rsquo;d looked into last week. So, yesterday I visited the International Museum of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. My visit there really helped me understand the difference between the ICRC, the IFRC, and the national chapters. Understanding the difference will be really important if I choose to apply for a job with one of them. I also learned a bit about the history of humanitarian principles and law, which will be covered more in my Essentials of Humanitarian Practice class the week after next. Alas, it was also pretty depressing, since the message you get from the museum is \u0026ldquo;people have been doing pretty terrible things to each other for a long time, and the trend seems to be towards even more terrible things\u0026rdquo;. I really don\u0026rsquo;t think the museum curators are trying to send that message, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the inescapable conclusion you come to, if you\u0026rsquo;ve got your eyes open and your brain engaged.\nThe most fascinating display was the 1/3 linear mile of shelving holding the actual archives of the records used to do tracing of prisoners of war during World War I. Seeing the shelves with your own eyes makes the scale of the war, and of the work the Red Cross did during it very clear. From a practical point of view, it was also interesting to see how a large information processing problem was solved in a time when IT was pieces of colored paper and quill pens. That kind of work is now done with software from people like HRDAG (an organization I might like to work for).\nI learned something else at the museum that I bet most people don\u0026rsquo;t know. The Geneva conventions that are in effect now are different from the ones that were in effect at the onset of WWII. At that time, the laws of war only protected the combatants, not the civilians affected by war. The first Geneva conventions were motivated by the experience of WWI, which was fought closer to the \u0026ldquo;old style\u0026rdquo; war: between armies, on battle fields, away from civilians. Because civilians were not protected at the onset of WWII, the Red Cross was unable to do it\u0026rsquo;s normal inspection, relief, and tracing work in the Nazi concentration camps. Through intense negotiations, they managed to do some work in some of the camps, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the kind of access they have today in conflicts. It was only after WWII that the need to protect civilians in time of war was codified into law.\nToday I visited CERN, the European research center for high energy physics. This is where the quark was discovered, and other cool physics stuff happened. There is a really neat tour where you get to go down in the tunnels and everything, but it needs to be booked decades (ok, months) in advance, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to go on it. Instead I visited Microcosm, which had really great science exhibits and old aparatus. Nifty!\nTonight I got to see Philippe and Sara, who I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen since the last time I was in Montreal, long long ago. Philippe was my first ever office partner, and he taught me quite a lot about how to do engineering in the presence of silly corporate behavior. A good skill to have.\nTomorrow morning I\u0026rsquo;m getting up early to see Sima off to work, then I\u0026rsquo;ll take off to the airport an hour or so later. I\u0026rsquo;ll find something to do in London to occupy myself tomorrow afternoon (maybe the London Transit Museum), then show up at Lisa\u0026rsquo;s house around 5 pm. We\u0026rsquo;ll have a few days together before she heads off to Iceland for the weekend. I\u0026rsquo;ll be staying in London for the weekend, as Iceland is perhaps the one place I could go after visiting London and Geneva where I could spend more money. I plan to see Bletchly Park and track down the house my mom lived in when she lived in London as a kid. She had scarlet fever there, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably keep my distance. I\u0026rsquo;ve just finally pretty muched kicked the sinus infection I got after getting a cold in Mexico City!\nOn Monday evening, I need to be back in Leiston Abbey for my next RedR class. As there is no Internet in Leiston, I will drop off the face of the planet again.

So in absolute terms, I guess it was more bad than good, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel that way.\nThe feeling crappy part started about the time I arrived. The first couple days I wasn\u0026rsquo;t having typical traveler problems, but felt like I was right on the edge, and didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to eat. Of course, not eating will also make you feel crappy, so it was a no win situation. Then I got a cold. I think the worst is over on the cold now, but I just need to take it easy and make it go away before I arrive in London. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve been average, or maybe a little under average sick compared to other people traveling in the same regions, so I consider myself lucky.\nGetting safely cooked food in Mexico City is actually pretty easy, if you keep your eyes open and don\u0026rsquo;t eat at the first place you see. I prefer places where I can see the entire cooking process, and dishes that come right off the grill or out of the fryer. If you can watch the food for the 5 seconds between when it leaves 300 degrees and you start to eat it, it is hard to see how it will get contaminated without your knowledge.\nWhile we are on the topic of food, I need to admit to the most dangerous food I ate on the trip\u0026hellip; twice (twice! like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t learn from the first time!) I bought chicken salad sandwiches from the vendors who crowd onto chicken buses. The chicken salad was, to put it charitably, luke warm. In both cases, I was hungry enough to eat it, but thinking back on it now I cannot fathom how I could have possibly been that hungry. Neither time did I get directly sick from them, but they might have contributed to generic malaise.\nOn the way to the Metro I pass a place that sells oysters. They sit out on a table all day without any ice. It about gives me food poisoning just looking at them! I advert my eyes and hustle past.\nThe street hawkers in Mexico City are no worse than anywhere else, but because the city is so big and it takes a long time to get places, you are exposed to them for way more time than other places. Nothing about using the buses or the metro is tricky, but it just takes time and it gets old. Stack on top of that the constant need to be vigilant against pickpockets and worse (for Mom\u0026rsquo;s sake we won\u0026rsquo;t go into it here, but if you really want to know, read what the State Department says). With all that, it is just a pain to travel anywhere other than from my bed to the living room of the hostel.\nBut when you get to the destinations, they are neat!\nThe opera house, where I saw the Ballet Folklorico last night was one of the coolest art deco buildings I have ever had a good look at. There are pre-Hispanic influences in the art deco styling! I saw a couple of elements (a light and a door) that I would kill to have in my house someday. Not my beloved 43 Arch, though. Putting art deco stuff in a Craftsman bungalo has got to be some kind of sin up there with coveting another person\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; art deco lamp. This house will have to be next door in San Carlos, where there are a couple art deco structures on the main street of town. The lamp I loves so much looks like a set piece from Frankenstein, but in luxiourious brass with a marble base. I should have tried to grab it. (Well, maybe not. Did I mention it was over 20 feet tall?)\nThe museums here are first rate. The way they display the sun stone (which used to be called the Azte calendar stone) is just really incredible. It is hanging up on a wall over all the other stuff in the room. It appears that the architect designed the building for that artifact alone!\nToday I went to Xochomilco, where there are boats in canals and pretty nursuries on the shore. The canals are supposed to be leftover from Tenoctitlan, but I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced. It seems to me that over 500 years, the canals would change just a bit. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t difficult to imagine how the agriculture of the old city worked. The other cool thing was how the culture of the Mexican street vendors transfered onto boats in order to cater to the people on boat tours. There was the Polaroid Camera boat guy, the kitchen-on-a-boat, which tied up to your tour boat turning it into a restaurant-on-a-boat. And of course the ever popular mariachis-on-a-boat. We saw a big party that had over 100 people. They were in 8 or more boats tied together into a raft so big, other boats had trouble passing on the edges!\nTomorrow I head home in the afternoon. I will get to the airport way early to make sure everything is cool. In the morning, I might try to slip in one more sightseeing walk or something, depending on how I am feeling.\nNow would be a good time to post some concluding remarks about how my trip changed me as an individual or some bullshit. But really, I just picked up a few more skills for how to take care of myself in countries other than the US and Europe. I made good progress on learning Spanish, but I have thousands of words to learn still. I met nice people, but none that are going to change my life (yet). I arranged the next two steps of my journey towards getting a new job in the humanitarian aid world. So pretty much, mission accomplished.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have any mystical experiences in the Mayan world that convinced me it was my new home. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to doing the job I arranged for myself in San Pedro, but I\u0026rsquo;m not longing to return there or anything. It would be fun to bring friends and family to some of the places I saw in Guatemala, which would also give me a way to use some of my travel and language skills.\nI had a lot of time to think about what I missed from home, and the answers were not entirely surprising. That thinking, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really have ready for written words yet, is in tune with the change I am in the middle of making in my life, so there\u0026rsquo;s no radical adjustments I need to make, instead I need to just keep plugging away at my todo list.\nAnd shake this stupid cold. Sniff.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/05/12/heading-home/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAccording to Karl, who is picking me up at the airport tomorrow night, I am flying home tomorrow to SFO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ends several days in Mexico City, and over two months in Guatemala and Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy time in Mexico City has been spent on three things: feeling a little crappy, being hassled moving around the city, and seeing cool stuff.

Also I am in a bit of a hurry, so here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve been up to the last few days.\nI spent several relaxing days in Oaxaca. I spent a morning doing museums. I found an artist I think Evi would like. I kept hoping some of his seascapes would have a sailboat instead of big passenger ships, but no luck. I think it was Francisco Guiterrez, but I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at rememberinbg artist names.\nThe museum of culture in Oaxaca was really neat. It is in a freshly restored church that was occupied by the Mexican army for many years. It is really beautiful. The pieces show how the native people lived before the conquest, then showed how the indigenous people merged their culture with the Spanish one in order to survive, and in fact thrive. It showed several trades where the natives picked up the skills and technology, then outcompeted the Spanairds themselves, by making better stuff, cheaper.\nConquest reminds me\u0026hellip; I was talking about a girl I wanted to date. My teacher told me in Spanish, \u0026ldquo;Good luck on your conquest!\u0026rdquo; I thought she was kidding, but they really do use the same word for conquest and for \u0026ldquo;successfully woo a girl\u0026rdquo;. I think I need to investigate this phenomena more\u0026hellip;\nI also went to Monte Alban, which was like all ruins everywhere, essentially hot rocks. But the views were really good, so I was glad I went.\nYesterday I arrived in Puebla, and when I got off the bus I met a Japanese girl that was on my bus too. She and I shared a cab in to the city, and then ended up sharing a room to save money since there were only two-bed rooms in the hotel. We are going out to dinner with a friend of hers who lives here tonight.\nTomorrow I will take a bus in the morning to Mexico City. I think I will meet up with a girl I met in San Cristobal. She\u0026rsquo;s heading north towards Mexico City too right now. Our flights leave within a day or so, so we are pretty much destined to be travel buddies in Mexico, a city where it is especially helpful to have someone watch your back. Mexico City is probably as dangerous as Guatemala, at least for foreigners, but the problem is there are things to see in Mexico City, so people go there and spend time there. Guatemala City, on the other hand, is on really big, noisy, dangerous bus terminal, at least for travelers.\nOh, one more thing: I saw a railroad museum in Oaxaca, and one here in Puebla too. The one here had more cars, but less interesting artifacts to look at. Both were free, which was nice.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/05/08/in-puebla/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt is the weekend, so I\u0026rsquo;ve decided I don\u0026rsquo;t have to write in Spanish.

Yesterday morning as I got ready to leave I thought I might go to Chichicastenango for the world famous market. But it turns out I was off by a day and would have needed to kill some time. Time is not on my side right now, as there are lots of fun things between here and Mexico City airport.\nI realized it was better to head north, since I know I am coming back to Lake Atitlan. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing of tourist interest on the route to San Cristobal las Casas in Chiapas, Mexico. So I decided to just go for it and spend one miserable day traveling as far as I possibly could, then spend the time I saved recuperating. The jury is still out on whether that was a good idea. By the time I got to the Mexican border, I was pretty damn worn out. I made a mistake telling the guy how many days I would be in Mexico so I probably will need to figure out how to extend my visa. I decided to stop in Comitan last night when I was so tired and sore that I could hardly walk. The bed was worse than in San AndrÃ¨s, if that\u0026rsquo;s even possible. I had a terrible headache at dinner which was only partly solved by eating and drinking, which I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done enough of during the day of traveling. At 3 am I woke up and took some Tylenol, which was an improvement. When I sleep fitfully nowdays (perhaps because of the bed, or noise or whatever) I spend the whole night struggling to conjugate Spanish verbs. I don\u0026rsquo;t do this on purpose\u0026hellip; in fact several times I remember telling myself in English to just GIVE UP and sleep. I was in fairly good shape this morning. I made my way to San Cristobal las Casas, where I am now.\nToday I will rest and see the sights here a little bit.\nI am signed up for a tour to Sumidero Canyon tomorrow. Tomorrow night I will stay in Palenque, then get up early and visit the temples in the cool morning air. After that I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the plan is\u0026hellip; I will probably get out of Palenque as soon as possible because it is really touristy.\nI want to spend several days around Oaxca because there are treks up in the mountains that look like they will be fun.\nMy trip to London (and thus also my short stay in the US) is finalized. I will be in the US from May 13 (late) to May 18 (afternoon). You know your visit home is too short when you resort to including the times in the dates! I will be in Redwood City Saturday morning (May 14), and would like to see people. Perhaps a big breakfast at Hobees is in order. The rest of the time I will be at the cabin in the mountains with my parents. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to drop by up there, we\u0026rsquo;d love to see you too!\nI have started contemplating how to get back to Lake Atitlan cheaply and funly (sorry, bad habit from Spanish, where all the adjectives can be adverbed). Current ideas include a flight to Cancun (because they are always cheap), train to San Diego (expensive, but I have always wanted to do it) and then buses down Baja California and the rest of Mexico to Guatemala. There\u0026rsquo;s also the boring idea of just flying into Guatemala City, but that sounds not only boring but expensive.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/30/en-mexico/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNo tengo mi dicionario, etonces hoy voy a escribir solamente ingles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left San Pedro yesterday and started my trek north to Mexico City.

Today is Monday, and I am back with more homework. I have several things to write about today, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have a better title.\nAdventure\nThis weekend, we went up in the mountains to visit a zipline. It was really fun! The clouds surrounded the mountains, so the cable disappeared into the clouds and so did I. On the other side, all the world appeared again. They have two ziplines there, one short and one long. The long one was 250 meters.\nBen brought his girlfriend, Maria, and a friend from church named Dawn. I think Dawn would make a perfect playmate for Evi. I told Dawn all about my trip in the sailboat Wonderland. Perhaps Dawn will sail in the future.\nWork\nI learned a lot about Planet Online from Ben. I also met an employee named Juan. I like what Ben and the others have made here, and I will probably work with Planet Online in July and August. I will teach the employees, formally and informally. I will work on other projects too. I will study a bit too, but I do not yet know how many hours per week.\nThe Mills\nThere is a mill near my house. It is a good alarm clock because it starts at 5 in the morning. The mill is not very noisy but the motor is. It has a one cylinder diesel motor without a muffler. The exhaust pipe goes straight up. In the street, it is not very noisy, but in the second and third floors of the house, it is much noisier. I have been curious about the mills for all of my trip. Because of the noise, it is not possible to ask any questions. Last night too late for it to run, I noticed the door do the building was open, and the owner was in the interior. I went in to ask questions!\nHe has four mills, two for masa (corn flour dough), one for salsa (pureed tomatoes), and one for coffee. Only two have diesel motors, and the others are electrical. He charges Q0.50 (about 1/14th of a dollar) for enough masa for tortillas for breakfast for a family of 6 to 8. When I interrupted him, he was sharpening the wheel for the mill. Every 30 minutes of operation it needs a new wheel. He adds water into the mill too for cooling. When the masa leaves the mill, it is a little bit warm.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/25/mas-tarea/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eÂ¡Hola! Hoy es Lunes y estoy volvo para mas tarea.

This weekend I traveled to Monterico in the south of Guatemala, on the Pacific coast.\nIn Dakar, boys and other guys always offer to help, but they expect to be paid. Here I don\u0026rsquo;t have that problem. In Monterico, a boy next to me in the boat followed me. I spoke with him politely, but I did not use his help because I did not want to pay him. I spoke with a French guy that works in a bar. He suggested a hotel that did not appear in any of the books. The boy stopped me before I entered the wrong hotel. With his help, I found the right hotel. Because he helped me, I bought Cokes for both of us. We sat and enjoyed the drinks. I told him, \u0026ldquo;You should work in tourism because you are a good helper!\u0026rdquo;.\nThe waves in Monterico were stronger than any other waves I have seen.

Because I liked Lake Atitlan so much, and because I am trying to meet up with Ben from Planet Online to explore the possibility of working for them for a few months, I decided to plan myself in San Pedro a little village on lake Atitlan. I have not been there yet but it seems to be much more like San AndrÃ©s, which I liked so much, so I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful.\nOn Friday morning I said goodbye to the family in Xela. I\u0026rsquo;d left a gift with my family in San AndrÃ©s after staying there two weeks, a book of pictures of California. I wanted to give my family in Xela a gift too, but I wanted to save the other book I had for the family I stayed with two weeks. So I went out and bought a ball for the little girl in the family. It was really sweet when I gave it to her. I showed it to her and told her it was a gift for her. Her eyes got really big and she immediately said a big thank you. We took it in to show her grandma and she told little Miscelita to thank me. I said, \u0026ldquo;She already thanked me, she\u0026rsquo;s a good girl.\u0026rdquo; Well, it probably didn\u0026rsquo;t sound like that with my pronounciation and hit or miss conjugations, but no matter how broken the Spanish, a compliment always makes a grandmother happy.\nI tried to meet up with the Seed of Hope people at a fundraiser, but it turned out it was sold out! That\u0026rsquo;s good for them, but bad for me. I hit a pizza place instead and ran into a girl I met in San AndrÃ©s there. She was part of a group called LEAP Now, which is mostly for people between high school and college. She was the one I liked the most from her tour group, so it was lucky she\u0026rsquo;s the one I ran into. We chatted all through dinner. Sounds like the group is undergoing some problems right now\u0026hellip; maybe by the time you read this someone will have been voted off the island! Hope not, even the bozos were all pretty good kids. But boy did they make me feel old and wise. Jeeze.\nSo Friday was taken up by travel all the way to the southernmost city on the Pacific coast (at least on my Lonely Planet map). Monterico is a vacation hotspot for Guatemaltans and backpackers alike. I stayed in a great new hotel that is not in any of the books, Hotel Brisa del Mar. It is one block off the black sand beach, and being brand new is really clean and pretty. If anyone is reading this and planning on visiting Monterico, I heartily recommend it. The hotel\u0026rsquo;s restaurant, however, is a different story. The service there was a bit spotty, and the food wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything to really crave. It was clean, and the portions were good, but I\u0026rsquo;d recommend looking around for food other places.\nThe hotel is built in little bungalos with three rooms and three doors per bungalo. It turns out both my neighbors in the other two rooms in my bungalo were heading to the same language school in Xela. What\u0026rsquo;s even crazier is that one of them had just come from my next school in San Pedro! So we turned into a little group to travel today. I went with them north as far as Escuintla, then took a different bus onwards. The girl who had been at my school warned me of some problems she had, and given her experience I know what to watch out for and speak up about. It would have been nice for her to say, \u0026ldquo;My week there was perfect!\u0026rdquo;, but it is helpful to hear the other side of things too. Even if my week turns out like hers, I\u0026rsquo;d probably stay. She moved on partly for her own reasons.\nRight now I am in Panajachel taking a little break from traveling to get money and do Internet stuff. I suspect San Pedro will be off the net like San AndrÃ©s, so I need to check in now. Ok, I just got around to reading the book and it turns out San Pablo has a bank and Internet access afterall. No harm stopping here, it is on the way anyway; there are water taxis to San Pedro from here. I need to be in San Pedro tonight at 6 pm to meet my family.\nLook forward to a second language on this website (and in these emails) this week, as I plan to assign myself a new homework assignment: write an entry in Spanish every day for the next two weeks. Here is a teaser and a reminder to myself of things I want to write about: fincas en la camino a Panajachel, y el mar Pacifico del Guatemala. Nesecitar otre topics, etonces ellos deben pregundar!\nOff I go to prove another of Jeff\u0026rsquo;s travel tips once again: any trip which is possible in a boat or a bus is better taken in the boat!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/17/weekend-in-monterico/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs predicted in my last post, I decided to ditch Xela and find someplace else to study for the next two weeks.

It has several universities, so it is rumored to have the benefits of a university town. I did notice a flyer for a tofu store last night, so I guess that\u0026rsquo;s one of the benefits (?) of a university town. However, it is still a big city, which turned out to be a real shock to my system. I knew it was a city when I decided to come here, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how accustomed I had become to rural Guatemala. The city is dirty and noisy and drove me crazy for the first little bit. I might still flee.\nMy house is comfortable, but the food had two problems: there was too little, and it was really bad. Lunch the first day was a small bowl of chicken soup. So I figured dinner was the big meal for this family. But dinner was one egg and about 100 grams of beans, with this horrible local version of Wonder Bread. The family never eats tortillas, just this really fake tasting bread and these things they call tamales. Tamales (in this house) are corn flour cooked in a corn husk like Mexican tamales, but without anything inside. They are supposed to be like tortillas, but they are heavy and not very useful for making dinner interesting. Breakfast the next morning was the exact same as dinner the night before: one egg and 100 grams of beans. I decided to see what was for lunch, then talk to the director of the school to find out if these four meals were considered normal and acceptable. Lunch turned out to be vegetables boiled in water with egg, rice, and guacamale. This time there was enough, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really very good. I ate out in the town yesterday morning in order to get enough to eat.\nI asked the director about the food and he said it\u0026rsquo;s normal that a family has to adjust to each new student. (But since this family has been hosting students for over 8 years you\u0026rsquo;d think the issue of starvation would have come up before.) He asked what I wanted, and I gave some ideas (2 eggs for breakfast and dinner, a full meal with meat at lunch, tortillas or rolls, fruit with breakfast). He then decided to call the family for me. That was really nerve wracking, because it felt like I was \u0026ldquo;telling\u0026rdquo; on mi madre to her \u0026ldquo;boss\u0026rdquo; without talking to her first. When I got home that night I explained that I had gone to the director because I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what food was normal here in Xela and did not expect him to call her before I had a chance to talk to her. That little white lie went over Ok, but the madre definately had her feelings hurt some. Arrgh.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a difficult situation because while I\u0026rsquo;m not expecting to be waited on hand and foot, I am a customer. I am paying for room and board, and I chose that option because I felt the amount I\u0026rsquo;d pay for food would be fair compared to the amount I would spend in restaurants if I were staying in a hotel. Having to eat in restaurants to supplement what I get at home was not part of the deal.\nMy teacher is OK. She\u0026rsquo;s studying to be a lawyer, and is clearly pretty experienced at teaching Spanish. She sometimes talks full speed and I just look at here like a deer in the headlights and she remembers and starts again, pero despacio. She is reviewing stuff I learned in San AndrÃ©s, which is frustrating because I cannot see forward progress as measured by new stuff written in my notebook. But it\u0026rsquo;s clear I don\u0026rsquo;t really know the old stuff yet, so there\u0026rsquo;s no point in piling on new stuff, I guess.\nIn general I was really discouraged and ready to leave on Friday by the end of the day yesterday. The food situation has improved some in terms of volume, and breakfast had no beans, two eggs, better bread, and some watermelon. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping lunch will knock my socks off, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really expect it to.\nI have one main job remaining here in Guatemala before I can start heading north towards Mexico City, which is to investigate several volunteer opportunities I\u0026rsquo;ve come across. I\u0026rsquo;m coming to the conclusion that it would be much better for my Spanish education and my budget to work here for free than to try to work in the US in a Spanish language environment. It all comes down to the cost of living, which is so much lower here. If I can find the right job and the right city, I think it would be a fine way to spend 2 or 3 months. But it seems likely that Xela is not the right city.\nThere are places to study Spanish north of here in Oxaca, and I thought about hitting the road and going up there. But I still want to talk to Ben from Planet Online and see if working for them makes sense. He and I plan to get together the weekend after next, which means I need to stick around here in Xela for a while longer.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/13/life-in-xela/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve had a few days to settle in to Xela now, so here\u0026rsquo;s some info about life here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXela is Guatemala\u0026rsquo;s second biggest city, but it is a distant second to Guatemala City, with only 120,000 residents.

New travel tip: use the addresses, not the dots on the maps. Apparently the dots are added to the map by a blind left handed dart thrower.\nThis weekend I spent at Lake Atitlan. On the night before I left Antigua, I was feeling a bit shy and figured I would just end up eating alone someplace. But I decided to make a swing through the park looking for a gringo who wanted to catch dinner. I found a really nice woman and her mother from England. The woman had been through Antigua several times in her travels and was a mini traverlers information desk. She sent me to a great little restaurant. Alas, I was still alone. At the restaurant, I pulled out my Lonely Planet and started doing research on Lake Atitlan. I tend to plan my travel in broad strokes, then do the final detailed planning at the last minute. A guy at another table was clearly doing the same thing, and it turned out we were heading opposite directions. So I sat with him and helped him with his \u0026ldquo;homework\u0026rdquo; and he helped me with mine. He told me about a cool place on Lake Atitlan named Jabalito.\nThere is a cliffside hotel there called Casa del Mundo. Lonely Planet says it is magical and boy were they right! The entire first day I was there I just kept thinking this isn\u0026rsquo;t really real. It is built into the cliff with lots of little one room buildings for extra rooms. It has an incredible view of one of the volcanos, and beautiful gardens everywhere. The swimming area is in the little cove with rocks to jump off of and everything. The only problem was that I was so in love with it I immediately wanted to share it with everyone in my life and got a tiny bit lonely and homesick thinking how much nicer it would be if I had a girlfriend and/or some parents with me to share it. Next time!\nThe hotel serves dinner family style, so everyone gets to talk and learn about each other. There\u0026rsquo;s also a wood fired hot tub that we went out in one night, which helped us get to know each other even better. I met lots of cool people. The coolest one is a pediatrician from San Francisco. She and I plan to get together when we get back to California. There was also a dreadlock-wearing defense attorney, two human rights workers (one paralegal, one forensic anthropologist), two architects working on the new stuff for the World Trade Center site, two girls who used to work for Anderson Consulting (in Australia and England) and various other cool people.\nCasa del Mundo is very expensive compared to the normal backpacker budget, which might have explained why I liked the people so much. The price range filtered people out by age and work experience somewhat, so virtually everyone there was the same age and had interesting lives to talk about.\nI went kayaking in the lake, and swam in it every day. One day, I went for a sunrise swim, which was really great.\nIt is time to get home for lunch now. My classes are in the afternoon this week because they don\u0026rsquo;t have room in the morning. That\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a bummer, but it is way cooler here in Xela, so working in the afternoon won\u0026rsquo;t be too bad. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I will do with my mornings, but high on my list is visiting Seeds of Hope to see if it would be a good place to volunteer. I am also working on getting in touch with a friend of Mak Verber\u0026rsquo;s, who runs an NGO named Planet Online.

I have never seen so many guns as I have here. That includes growing up in a working class, rural city in the US.\nYou see guns on the belts of police, and there are an average number of police here by US standards. But that\u0026rsquo;s just the beginning\u0026hellip; lots of stores hire private security guards, and they are almost without exception armed. Every bank has an armed guard quickly questioning every person who wants to come through the door (one bank had a man-trap too, which is a pair of doors forming a vestibule, wired so that only one can be open at a time). Probably 70% of the delivery trucks have an armed security guard literally riding shotgun. When the truck stops, the guard gets out and watches the truck while the driver makes the delivery of Coca-Cola or whatever.\nSecurity guards almost always carry some kind of shotgun with no stock, just a pistol grip. It looks pretty cool, in a Hollywood prop kind of way. They have plenty of live ammo in their belts. I have not yet gotten the nerve up to strike up a conversation and find out if the keep a shell chambered too, though I suspet they do. For my liberal peace loving hippy friends out there, the distinction is a big deal. Even US police and military armed guards, under normal conditions, keep their shells far away from their guns. Having a shell chambered is just a pump and a trigger pull away from making a big hole in something or someone.\nSo that would be a lot of guns, even for hick from the US like me. But it keeps going\u0026hellip; it is quite easy to get a permit to carry a firearm as a private citizen. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it is required by law, or just fashionable, but men invariably wear them prominently. Sometimes in holster, sometimes just a pistol stuck in their jeans. I\u0026rsquo;m not making this up\u0026hellip; I think maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve watched too many Dirty Harry movies. The other day on the boat ride to Puerto Barrios, one of the businessmen on board had a pistol on his belt. Made me wonder a little about how much fun Puerto Barrios was going to be.\nLike probably everywhere in the world, peace in Guatemala brought less military and more crime. So there\u0026rsquo;s a legitimate need for security guards, but the overwhelming and completely public show of force was pretty surprising to me.\nThe only way the guns have really changed my behavior is to make me more polite. This is an argument the Texans, bless their gun-loving hearts, make. When I go to pass a delivery truck, I always try to find the guard and make eye contact and give him a really nice \u0026ldquo;Buenos Dias\u0026rdquo;. Afterall, I don\u0026rsquo;t ever want one of those guys to be surprised as I pass between him and his truck. They stand with their back to the wall away from the truck, so you have to pass between them and the truck.\nInfections\nOK, this is kind of icky, but it is interesting. The germs in Central America grow faster than back home. I\u0026rsquo;m sure some of it is just that I\u0026rsquo;m always hot and sweaty here, but I think the germs are meaner too. But somehow you seem to heal a little faster too. I can\u0026rsquo;t explain that part of it. What it means is that if a cut starts to heal without getting infected, you\u0026rsquo;re home free. But if it gets infected, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to really keep on top of it to get it to heal. I predict I\u0026rsquo;ll be hitting a pharmacy up for more antibiotic ointment before I head home. I use it like parmesan cheese on top of spaghetti. Oooh, sorry. That was a little more gross than even I was going for.\nAnyway, Matt, a gringo working at a park in San AndrÃ©s made the observation that organic farming ought to be way easier here than back home. He says that you can compost a pile of waste here in two months that would take a year back home. The ambient temperature and humidity is perfect for it in the PÃ©ten, and there\u0026rsquo;s much more aggressive bugs here.\nMore Guatemalan Engineering\nA few more examples of repeated materials and techniques. Wire makes virtually any sort of hardware, from a hinge to a lock. They use the same system here for making a quick and easy gate in a barbed-wire fence that I saw in Wyoming on my drive to Alaska. (If you are interested, ask me to draw it in person sometime, it\u0026rsquo;s not worth trying to explain here.)\nInner tube is the ideal material for both a lid (use some wire to catch it under the lip of the tank), or for anything requiring spring. Sometimes gates are sprung with innertube. Sometimes you see it holding a truck closed (or in extreme cases, together).\nGuatemalans speed bumps breed with about twice the virulence of the germs in the cut on my ankle. Which wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem, except that shocks seem to be considered optional equipment by SAT, the Guatemalan DMV. So even when someone says, \u0026ldquo;Â¡Hay no problemo, ees paved!\u0026rdquo; the road will still be about as bad as a dirt road, but with less dust.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/07/more-guatemala-observations/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome more random observations about Guatemala\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuns\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople say Americans are crazy gun toting cowbows, but the real Americans who love their guns are the Central Americans of Guatemala.

From Puerto Barrios to Guatemala City it was pretty comfortable. We were on a Mercedes bus which dated to the 80\u0026rsquo;s, judging by the decor.\nI invented another of my somewhat random travel tips. (You might remember the last one: when out of ideas on how to solve a problem, sit down and wait for something good to happen.) This tip is simpler: always sit on the side of the bus where a thief will pick up your luggage from. Here in Guatemala it is the right side, because they only load and unload it from that side. Then you can watch whenever bags come and go and see if any look a little too familiar. As it turns out, I need not have worried because they issued actual bag tags, and the guy actually checked the number before giving me my pack! That doesn\u0026rsquo;t even happen in Amerian airports!\nI arrived in Guatemala and pulled a Karl. (Sorry Karl, but you earned this.) I decided one way to be less of a mark in Guatemala City was to not use my map. The streets are in a simple grid, so it should not have been difficult to get to 18th calle and 4th avenida. The problem was that I confused avenues and streets and went to 18th avenida and 4th calle. As though sent from heaven, a taxi cab where there when I figured out my mistake. Now would be another good time for a Jeff Travel Tip: when you\u0026rsquo;ve screwed up walking to someplace in a big city, don\u0026rsquo;t fix it by walking more (no matter how sure you think you are now about the right direction), just bite the bullet and pay for the damn taxi. I paid, and arrived at the Chicken Bus Coop.\n(Why is getting lost due to stubbornly refusing to look at a map called Pulling a Karl? Because in Fez, Morocco, Karl managed to explore and enjoy the wrong old city. Only in Morocco can you find the wrong old city. I think Fez has 3!)\nThe Chicken Bus Coop is my name for the place in Zona 1 where all the transport to various cities leaves from. It is absolute chaos. It was not made any better by the fact that there was an Antigua bus leaving right as I got there. I decided to try to make it and a guy helpfully took my pack preparing to throw it up top. I followed him, not wanting to be separated from my pack. Lucky thing too, because he was the conductor from the next bus back, and had stolen me from the departing bus\u0026rsquo; conductor. Luckily, no words were exchanged over this minor foul, perhaps because the other bus was already roaring away. (In Senegal we got put on the second bus in line once and it caused a huge mess while the conductors argued and the policeman who had been sitting under a tree nearby had to come straighten things out. Turns out the first bus has dibs on the tubobs.)\nThe bus ride to Antigua, being my first Chicken Bus ride was interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s an experience best simply experienced, so you all should just come on down and give it a try instead of having me explain it. I recorded some of the patter of the conductor as he tried to drum up business. I think it would make a great sample for a techno song. If any of you want to try making a \u0026ldquo;Chicken Bus Remix\u0026rdquo;, feel free to ask for the recording. The one detail of the experience that fell short of what I\u0026rsquo;d heard before was that there were no chickens. At least in Senegal I actually got to have a chicken under my seat.\nI arrived in Antigua and refined another Jeff Travel Tip: when you are in a bus station and people are pestering you (want a bus to someplace? want spanish school? are you american? want some beads?), just walk. Walk a block from the station and get your thoughts in order and your map aligned, etc. Normally you can do this on the bus in peace and quiet on your way in, but on a Chicken Bus, peace and quiet (let alone room to move your elbows to open the book) are hard to come by. I headed off in search of a hotel.\nI got lead around by the owner of the (full) hotel I came to first. I figured this was a replay of Livingston, but I\u0026rsquo;d at least humor the guy while he attempted to rip me off. But the hotel he took me to was fine, and even took my passport number and everything. I asked about locking my valuables in the safe, and the guy said, \u0026ldquo;You and the Canadian in your room are the only ones with keys. And he\u0026rsquo;s Canadian.\u0026rdquo; Good enough reasoning for me!\nMy big reason for being in Antigua is to hike up VolcÃ¡n Pacaya, which is active. So I immediately arranged a tour for the next morning at 6 am, then I went out for dinner early because lunch on the bus had been just enough to survive. (Jeff\u0026rsquo;s Travel Tip for buses: Never get on a bus without food and water. I think I got this one from Karl actually.)\nI ambled aross town to the restaurant the both the Canadian (who is probably stealing my passport right now) and the Lonely Planet recommended, Cafe Sky. It was a total Gringo spot, but the food and beers hit the spot. Nice conversation too. But really expensive\u0026hellip; $9 for two beers and dinner. That\u0026rsquo;s highway robbery by Guatemalan standards.\nThis morning I got up and did the volcano tour. It was awesome! It made up for the stupid tour in Livingston to a waterfall with no water. (I guess I forgot to mention that in my last update, intent as I was on talking about defrauding the fine hotel operator there.)\nThere were about 13 gringos on the tour. The closest to an American was a guy who carefully introduced himself as half Swedish and half (mumbling\u0026hellip;) American. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to find out if he had a legitimate reason for introducing himself that way (i.e. never lived a day in the US in his life or something) or if he was just being a spineless prick. I suspect it was the latter. That drives me crazy\u0026hellip; American travelers are the ambassadors for the part of the US that thinks about the state of the rest of the world. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t brave enough to stand up and say, \u0026ldquo;Yes, I am an American and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to fix things, so shut up\u0026rdquo; when some snippy Germans start picking on you, you should just stay the hell home.\nAhem. Pardon me while I stop frothing at the mouth. But it really pisses me off, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it a couple of times to varying degrees.\nAnyway, we hiked about 2 hours up to the top of the volcano and could see the vents throwing out lava in little and big explosions. It was really incredible, and awe inspiring. It was also, of course, a little bit dangerous. I stayed near the guide, figuring he knew best. He only let us stay near the vent for 5 or 10 minutes. Just enough to rest and get photos, then we headed down again. He clearly had instructions to watch the time and stay within the danger zone for under 60 minutes or something. When we got back to the place where grass was growing he looked visibly happier. I brought back a rock, probably one of the newest million rocks on the planet. How cool is that? You can see intricate details of how it pulled apart like taffy as the gas in it expanded as it was cooling.\nI got back to the hotel for a much needed shower. I plan to explore Antigua more this afternoon. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave for Xela tomorrow around 8am, unless I wake up early, which seems likely\u0026hellip; I woke up 4 minutes before my alarm clock went off this morning at 5:30. It is official, Guatemala has turned me into a morning person.\nThe weather here in Antigua is way more to my liking. It is Redwood City weather, low humidity agreeable temperature, cool in the evenings, etc. Hopefully Xela will be nice too.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/07/antigua/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI got to Antigual yesterday afternoon after a long bus ride most of the way aross Guatemala.

Everywhere you look you see people with Dole and Chiquita nametags on. The streets rumble with the sound of refrigerated containers full of bananas.

Traveling for me is always a treat, becaue in Silicon Valley the odd jut aren\u0026rsquo;t in your favor, even for simple people watching. But among travelers, there seem to be more women than men. And the women are the kind who are self possesed enough to travel outside their comfort zone, low maintenance enough to deal with cold showers and cockroaches, and smart enough to have not alread gotten themselves killed somehow. They are my kind of girls!

Us guys are all unkempt, dressed in tattered shorts and holey t-shirts and staggering drunk (ok, not me on the last one). They probably get homesick for the boys back at home, as any group of ruffians would be better than us traveler boys!\nToday\u0026rsquo;s big job was visiting the MSF clinic in Peurto Barrios. I called them when I got here and after struggling with the Guatemalan telephone system (Sam: ask me later about www.8digitos.com) I finally got them. Turns out the doctors (including the head of the project) work in the hospital in the morning, and in the office from 1500 to 1900. So I had to wait until 1500 to see anyone. OK, so I get to spend the night in Puerto Barrios, no big deal. I went out of town to a swimming hole that the MSF staffer recommended and killed time. At 1515 I called the office and got invited over. They were a little confused why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just applying for a position with MSF-US in New York, but I convinced them that I was just between language courses and only wanted to talk about their program, not apply for a job. The head of the project didn\u0026rsquo;t speak English (or maybe as good as my Spanish \u0026ndash; and the intersections of those two vocabularies would not have made for an interesting converation!) so she had me talk to a doctor from Uraguay who is working there. She was really sweet and had a story much like mine. She gave me really useful information and wished me well. She also volunteered to keep in touch with me in e-mail. Someday, I\u0026rsquo;ll get to send her a happy email telling her I\u0026rsquo;ve been assigned to a post!\nOne other piece of news of note: for both breakfast and lunch I had my first flour tortillas of the trip. This is big news because I prefer them, but also because it indicates that Peurto Barrios has some different food than in the PÃ©ten. Interesting. Wonder what things will be like in Antigua tomorrow? I hit the road at 5 am tomorrow, so as to have plenty of time to get the hell out of Guatemala City before sundown!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/04/05/got-to-puerto-barrios/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI made it out of Livingston this morning with no problems.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a rather disorganized ramble of stuff.\nGuatemaltan Engineering\nGuatemalan engineering is remarkably similar to Senegalese engineering. I think this stems from a basic prinicple at work in poor places, which is do it just well enough to get the job done, and cheaply as the job will tolerate. This is a common reaction sharp humans have all over the world, but in less developed economies, the handicraft of the clever engineers is somehow more on display.\nWhen I say \u0026ldquo;engineers\u0026rdquo; here, I mean, \u0026ldquo;the people that make a place work\u0026rdquo;. They don\u0026rsquo;t need formal training, just the gut instinct for building new things and fixing old ones. In both Senegal and Guatemala, I have seen things that were clearly carefully designed by a highly trained professional. But much more often what you see is a small repetoir of repeated techniques using common materials.\nFor instance, Guatemalan electrical wiring is not exactly up to code. But it works reliably. Usually, the insulated wires are all exposed and you can see how it works. Connections are twisted and taped. There\u0026rsquo;s a small selection of wall-mountable switches, plugs, and light sockets at the ferreteria. (No, you don\u0026rsquo;t get ferrets there. It\u0026rsquo;s a hardware store.) They put them together into simple circuits that get the job done. An entire marketplace of stalls popped up on the beach for Semana Santa overnight. Several had music playing and cold beers. Turns out someone had run a line 200 meters or so down the hill from the nearest house and hacked together a little power network down there for the weekend. The next day, another place popped up further down the beach playing music. It had tapped into the same line running down the hill. They probably did it live, for all I know. The simplest thing that works, which in this case was an ad-hoc power distribution system for the weekend.\nI suppose they have fires from time to time from this less than perfect electrical engineering. But their houses are made of concrete, and there are constantly little fires by the side of the road to burn trash and leaves, so a little fire from the ad-hoc beach power network probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a big problem. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s the simplest thing that works: it works for them to have a small risk of fire, because it lets them use cheap parts and unskilled labor.\nWhat interests me here is the union of economics and engineering. Rural Guatemalans (and the Senegalese, and probably every other poor group of people in the world) have a keen sense of what works well enough and what\u0026rsquo;s worth paying for to make it work well enough. This is a sense I\u0026rsquo;m going to need to develop as I work more in poorer regions.\nOne place I saw a union of traditional (north american) heavy industry and local engineering was in the sawmill where mi padre works. He showed me the saw, the planer, the kiln, and the furnace for the kiln. It all looked just like the equipment I remember seeing in Roseburg area mills while growing up. Unfortunately, it was dark when I was there, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t examine it closely enough to confirm my suspicions that it was imported from decomissioned mills in the US. It was really fun talking with Audali in Spanish about the mill, since I have some knowldge of the lumber industry in Oregon.\nAs a parting note, today I took a shower under a just-in-time water heater showerhead. It was interesting wondering when the typically installed Guatemalan wires leading to the showerhead would end up in the stream of lukewarm water, thereby electrocuting me to death!\nWater Distribution in San AndrÃ©s\nMy Spanish lessons included several different types of teaching, but my favorite (though at times the most trying) was simply talking in Spanish with my teacher. At the beginning, the teacher prompted it from time to time by asking carefully crafter questions he knew the answer to and knew I had enough words to answer. Very clever, as it increased my confidence and comfort with the language. This was the benefit of starting with a teacher with 10 years of experience, I bet! Later, the conversations were more free ranging, and I could drive them towards things I wanted to learn about.\nOne day I decided to learn how the water and the economics of water worked in San AndrÃ©s worked. I had learned from Eric Brewer that poor people typically pay much more for comodities than rich people do. I wanted to gather data on that phenonomen in San AndrÃ©s for Eric, and for my own curiosity.\nAs I mentioned before, there are two water systems in San AndrÃ©s: the tap water and the bottled water that the water man delivers. The tap water is untreated lake water. It is pumped from an inlet a bit to the west of the town into a tank at the top of the hill, and the system is gravity fed from there. It costs Q20 (USD $2.60) a month, and it is unmetered. It is provided by the city government (which may or may not be different from the county government\u0026hellip; I forgot to ask). The tap water always appears clean, i.e. it never has any sediment or bad smells. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it tastes like, because do one in the family drinks it. My teacher says that it is usually pretty safe to drink, especially by people accostomed to the local bacteria. The lake is quite big, and the wind tends to mix it around a bit. The amount of people living around it is very small by American standards of population density, so the amount of contamination is pretty low. Even though people aren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to, they wash clothes and bodies in the lake sometimes, which contaminates the lake. The biggest problem is after a rainstorm, when trash and animal waste from the streets washes into the lake. Then the tap water is a bit more peligroso.\nThe good news about contamination is that I never saw anywhere where there was untreated sewage flowing into the lake. In Senegal, there was a creek flowing into the bay where we anchored the boat which was black and smelled like it was untreated sewage. We didn\u0026rsquo;t swim off the back of the boat like we did in the Canaries sometimes! In San AndrÃ©s, they seem to use septic tanks to handle sewage. I spared my teacher the trauma of getting into the waste system during our lessons!\nThe people of San Jose next door used to get their water from a well, but it started smelling bad recently. Now they get their water from the lake too. However, their intake is much closer to the swimming area that would be allowed in the US. It has fencing, but no signs explining why people need to stay away. During the Semana Santa weekend, there were so many people at the beach that they overflowed into the fenced area, and were swimming all around the water intake. It would be interesting to ask the doctor in San Jose about the increase in sickness last week.\nThe bottled water man comes from Santa Elena (15 km away) every day with his truck of full of water in 6 gallon bottles with black and yellow seals on the lids. Each one costs about Q6 (USD $0.80). Lubia bought about 6 bottles a week for her family of 10 or so. So you can see that drinking water is a huge expense compared to tap water!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/03/31/thoughts-from-the-last-few-weeks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of time to think, and wanted to put down some of the stuff I came up with in the last few weeks.

A different crowd has moved into the city (I\u0026rsquo;m one of the old hands now!) and though some things are better, it feels like the right time to move on.\nThe new crowd is a 40 person group from TrekForce.org.uk. They have had a 2 month adventure in Belize, and are now here for 4 weeks learning Spanish. There are four of them staying with my family, so it is easy to slack off and speak English instead of Spanish. In fact, it is required right now, because they don\u0026rsquo;t speak a word. Some are learning faster than others, but as 18 year old British youth, they don\u0026rsquo;t have very broad horizons and are taking a while to catch on to Spanish.\nSo, off I go. I plan to head south for a weekend-long vacation and reward for myself at Finca Ixobel (pronounce the x as an sh, like the Mayans do\u0026hellip; there you go!).

I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to taking a horse ride and busting a move on the dance floor. Or maybe just chilling out in a hammock.\nNext I\u0026rsquo;ll go to Livingston, which is where the black slave descendants who speak Spanish live. Strange little place you can only get to with a boat. Then on to Puerto Barrio where I hope to visit an MSF clinic. I have not been able to get in touch with anyone there, so I plan to just show up and hope for the best. I\u0026rsquo;ll catch a bus to Guatemala City from there and head on to Antigua as soon as possible, possibly without even staying a night in Guatemala City. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to see there other than an MSF clinic, but it is likely in a very dodgy part of town so I\u0026rsquo;ll only try to find it if the Peurto Barrio thing falls through, or if they tell me I should drop by the Guatemala City one.\nIn Antigua, I\u0026rsquo;ll climb an active volcano (assuming it is not too active) then head north to Xela. Xela is the Mayan name for Quetzaltenango, which everyone uses because it is easier to say and spell. I plan to study for two or three weeks there. I\u0026rsquo;m also planning on checking out a program there called Seeds of Hope. I might consider traveling back to Guatemala after this trip for an extended stay there to immerse myself more in Spanish. It all depends on how I like the highlands, and how that program could use my help.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s the plan. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how it actually turns out!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/03/31/wheres-jeff-going/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter three weeks in San AndrÃ©s, I have decided to move on.

More about that later, if the power doesn\u0026rsquo;t go out.\nLast weekend I visited Flores for the Semana Santa (Saint\u0026rsquo;s Week, leading up to Easter) procession on Friday evening, and then visited Tikal on Saturday. The procession was interesting. They carried huge float-like things through the street. In the front was Jesus, lying in a casket thing. He was carried by the men of the church. There were at least 8 men down each side of it, and from the look of them, they could have used a few more. The next float back was the Vigrin Mary, which was carried by the women of the church. Then there were a couple more who I didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize carried by the young women of the church, and the boys. Along the procession route, which passed the 12 (I think?) stations of the cross (in front of people\u0026rsquo;s houses), people made designs in the street. They mostly used sawdust dyed different colors, but they also used things you might see in a table centerpiece for Thanksgiving, and chalk, and leaves from the forest. The leaves were especially fragrant after everyone walked on them. I got a few pictures of the designs they made. Most were very Catholic, and included the name of the sub-group of the church that made them. Like the Womens\u0026rsquo;s Group of the Church of So and So. Or the youth group, etc. One was quite different, and I found out from someone next to it that it was a Mayan god. Cool! Even infidels are invited to processionals here in Guatemala!\nThe \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; way for a backpacker to go to Tikal is to head up and spend the night, then bribe the guards to get in before sunrise and have some kind of mystical experience on top of the ruins at sunrise. This is no doubt fueled by the massive quantites of cheap pot they smoked the night before, probably with the same guards. Being older and lazier, and not really of a mystical bent, I just did the vanilla one day trip on a bus to see Tikal. I suppose I really should have partaken of the pot and whatnot, because to me, Tikal was just a bunch of very hot rocks in a very hot forest. I\u0026rsquo;m not the kind of person who goes crazy over rocks from old civilizations, but I suspect if I\u0026rsquo;d arranged to be there at a less hot time, I might have enjoyed it more. I\u0026rsquo;m really glad I went, but I\u0026rsquo;m even happier I\u0026rsquo;m not there right now, and won\u0026rsquo;t be ever again.\nHow hot was it, you ask? Funny thing\u0026hellip; I made the observation to my Spanish teacher this week that in places where is is very hot, you don\u0026rsquo;t see thermometers. I think it would just be too depressing. It is really difficult to judge the temperature anyway, because the humidity changes a lot from day to day, and that makes all the different to us vapor-cooled mammals. The best measurement of how hot it was in Tikal is that I drank over 3 liters of water that day and still got noticibly dehydrated. It took two days or so after I got back to get my intake and outflow of water to match up into the stable pattern I try to maintain while traveling. (Sorry to lapse into a discussion, however delicately put, about the color of my pee. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those things you just kind of have to learn to keep track of when you are on the road. As you all are virtually on the road with me, you get to find out all about it!)\nI did see a monkey with a baby on its back though. And some birds. But as I was there in the heat of the day, the wildlife viewing was less than average.\nOne final note in my defense\u0026hellip; it so happened that the best time for me to see Tikal was the weekend of Semana Santa, which made it impossible to get a hotel room. Again, if I was the intrepid backpacker type, that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have stopped me. (One guy told me you just drink with the guards and when they pass out drunk, you sleep in their hammocks. Clever guy, but not my style.) Being older and more boring, I opted for the one day trip.\nI spent my third week in San AndrÃ©s learning more Spanish. I\u0026rsquo;ve had several real world conversations with locals which were not limited to the normal stuff (where from, where to, what time, etc). I met one guy who is a mechanic, and somehow the conversation turned to San Francisco and movies and how ther are always great car chases in them, and the guy blurted out, after thinking for a bit, \u0026ldquo;Steve MacQueen!\u0026rdquo;. Much laughter ensued.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to finish up and post this now, in hopes I can beat the next power outage, which as I type is probably on its way.

If you are planning on contacting the Eco-Escuela, do not be fooled by the EcoMaya website. It seems to be some kind of regional, government supported tourism office which simply funnels people to Eco-Escuela, and might even take a cut for doing so. I was unable to get them to answer my e-mails after I declined to deposit 6 weeks of tuition into their account via wire transfer from the US (before I had even seen the place). Make sure to contact Eco-Escuela directly!\nWhen will I be home? My plane flight leaves, somewhat arbitarily, exactly 8 weeks after I arrived, May 13. It leaves from Mexico City and drops me back into San Francisco. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue what I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing when I get back to California. There\u0026rsquo;s also a remote chance I\u0026rsquo;ll change my plane trip to return much later from someplace else and continue to travel, or work someplace in Central America for a few months. Thanks to the short stint of work for Tellme I did in Virginia in February, I can afford to stay here for a very long time, if I want to. It is a bit difficult to stiffle my giggles when I hear post-college age kids here making decisions based on amounts less than 1 US dollar. My budget is just so, so different than theirs. There are some really nice things about getting older.\nNo one\u0026rsquo;s asked me this yet, but that last sentence reminds me of something else: it turns out, somehow during the last ten years or so, I got OLD. How did that happen? All the kids here are so, so, I dunno\u0026hellip; young. The trendy thing to do is to finish high school or college and then travel. Which means that gringos I see here are mostly younger than me. But the funny thing is that it takes a while of talking to me before enough details emerge (own a house, worked 10 years then decided to change jobs, etc) that it dawns on them that I\u0026rsquo;m older than the 24 or 26 they take me for. Playing that trick on the little kiddies never, ever gets old!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also met people of all other ages, too, though. Today I met a guy who is traveling because the bar he tended at for 10 years got bought and the new management didn\u0026rsquo;t keep him on. He looks about my age. I also met a couple of 40-50 year old travel enthusiasts who simply want to speak Spanish for their next vacation. And I met one 40-something divorcee who left a high stress job in the Canadian government to take a year off and enjoy life. She knew herself well enough to know that she\u0026rsquo;d need to ease into enjoyiong life, so she took, and I\u0026rsquo;m not making this up, a 6 month contract position as a telephone operator in Bosnia between her \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; job and this trip to Central America to \u0026ldquo;destress\u0026rdquo;.

We rented a minibus for the weekend and drove south to Semuc Champey. It is an area with lots of limestone and lots of water. Predictably, there are caves there, and other interesting things to see.\nWe caught the bus at 5 AM from the shack with no walls that serves as the bus station in San AndrÃ©s. We drove south for a couple of hours over fair roads, then headed up into the mountains. The driver knew a \u0026ldquo;short cut\u0026rdquo; that would make the trip take less\u0026hellip; something. We weren\u0026rsquo;t clear what, but he seemed to know where he was going. 6 hours later, after 70 kilometers of dirt road, we got there. It turned out that the short cut was meant to save diesel, and as we had neogotiated a fixed price for the trip out and back, it was to his advantage to try to save gas. I\u0026rsquo;m personally highly skeptical that a mountain road traveled at less than 20 km per hour saved any diesel over the slightly longer trip over pavement, but who am I to argue with a Guatemalan bus driver?\nThough we were wiped out after the long trip there, everyone agreed that the chance to see backcountry scenery and Guatemalan mountain life was well worth the trip. We also agreed that we\u0026rsquo;d rather stage a riot where we overturned the bus and lit it on fire then return by any road other than the paved one. We bought the bus driver a tank full of gas to end his protests to the contrary.\nSpeaking of burning vehicles, it turns out that last week there were some protests (or, as they call them here, manifestaciÃ³ns) around Guatemala. The people think that the government is going to screw them over by signing a free trade agreement with the USA. They noticed that Mexican farmers lost their farms and had to move to the cities to work in factories after NAFTA was signed. Those same workers are now losing their factory jobs, as those factories move to China in search of ever cheaper labor. The Guatemalans suspect the same thing is about to happen to them here. There was a protest in Santa Elena, nearby, but it was mostly peaceful. In little San AndrÃ©s the pigs seemed to be blocking my way to school one day, but it turned out there was just some corn spilled in the street. The protests in Guatemala City resulted in several deaths, which the government has promised to fully investigate. My teacher rolled his eyes when he translated that for me out of the newspaper.\nAnyway\u0026hellip;. at Semuc Champey, we saw a place where an entire river flowed into a hole in the ground, and then emerged later. Really impressive. It looked a little like Oregon\u0026rsquo;s rushing rapids, except that the rock was limestone instead of basalt, and the river was under the rock instead of on top of it. We swam in pools nearby (away from the tunnel of death-by-drowning, that is).\nThat night, I slept in a hammock outdoors. It was a good thing the hammock was under cover, because a huge storm with lightening and everything came through that night. It was cool to sleep out in it, but I was a bit cold, as I was only in shorts and a shirt.\nThe next day, we took a cave tour. It was pretty extreme, by American commercial cave tourism standards. We were each given candles, then the guide led us into the cave. After only 10 meters or so, we had to start swimming! We held the candles up and swum with the remaining three appendages. It was pretty dificult and a bit tiring. But each swim, with the exception of the final one, was less than 10 meters. Between swims, we walked in the cave and sometimes crawled over rocks. The final swim was really long, and it tired me out enough I dowsed my candle and did the backstroke instead. Swimming on my back watching the cave go by above me, illuminated by my companion\u0026rsquo;s candlelight, was really cool. We had to climb up and down several waterfalls inside the cave, and there was one place where you could jump from about 5 meters into a pool. I decided against that, but I did pass through an optional underwater tube, which was really, really creepy. At the end of the tour, we went through a tiny passage with water flowing through it too. It was really crazy!\nAt Semuc Champey, I met a really cool family (a mom, a dad, and a kid named Max). The mom is an epidemiologist for the American CDC working in a field station in Antigua. The dad does computer work. Right now he is telecommuting to do programming jobs for his wife\u0026rsquo;s colleages from her last job - in Tanzania. So he\u0026rsquo;s telecommuting from \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; in Guatemala to \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; in Tanzania. Top that, Silicon Valley types! She told me that she had heard that MSF might be getting ready to pull out of Guatemala. They had to do this after several aid workers were killed in Afganistan, but in Guatemala, it\u0026rsquo;s a happier situation. She and I guessed that they probably have seen the local government make enough progress that they are willing to leave the operation of the clinics to the locals.\nThis is an important part of why I like MSF: they understand the importance of closing as well as promptly opening programs. Having a track record of closing successful programs when the locals are able to take over shows other governments who they are dealing with that there\u0026rsquo;s an alternative to putting up with meddling foreigners: provide quality service on your own. It is, alas, human nature to resent the meddling of outsiders. Fine. So MSF seems to use it as an incentive to help people make good decisions on their own! (This is just my observation, not based on anything I have read about MSF.)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written to MSF asking if it will be possible to visit a clinic when I am in Guatemala City.

At 5 am or so, the roosters start making noise, which in turn wakes up the pigs who make snuffling noises in the street. In some parts of town, diesel powered corn grinders start up to grind the corn for the morning torillas. One gringa friend of mine here has one next door, and cheerfully uses it as an alarm clock. There are happily none near me, so I can sleep in. (I think my mama gets her tortillas from a tortilleria down the road.)\nAt 6 am, my alarm goes off. I get up, get dressed (t-shirt, shorts, Chacos) and wash my face. I have a private bedroom which is big enough, but probably a bit smaller than the one I lived in growing up. My window looks east, so I see the sunrise over the forest beyond the lake each morning. I\u0026rsquo;m not making this up. When I saw it the first morning I suspected I as just still dreaming. The bathroom is across the hall, and is quite a bit nicer than the one at Laye\u0026rsquo;s sister\u0026rsquo;s house in Senegal: the electrical doesn\u0026rsquo;t shock me, the toilet flushes without the use of a bucket, and the shower has a curtain.\n(All that, and it\u0026rsquo;s still nicer than Karl\u0026rsquo;s bathroom. When are you going to finish stripping that paint, Karl?)\nI head into the living room, and Lubia, mi madre is making pancakes. She gave me three the first day, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish them, so now she gives me two, which is just fine. I\u0026rsquo;m a little worried she\u0026rsquo;s going to fatten me up; she\u0026rsquo;s probably thinking the same thing. Sometimes I run into Herman, mi padre, unless he\u0026rsquo;s already gone to work at the lumber mill. I study a bit after breakfast then start off down the hill to school.\nSan AndrÃ©s is built on a hill overlooking the lake. That means virtually all of the houses have an amazing view, but walking around town is tough. Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s why Lubia gives me so much food. The walk to school is uno kilometre, mas o minus. The vertical elevation change has got to be at least 300 feet, maybe more. Mom and Nan, your knees would never be able to handle it. But maybe you could request a family on the same street at the school; the administration is very flexible.\nI get to school in time for my 7 am lesson. My teacher is Esdras, who is also an administrator at the school. He is a very experienced teacher. I suspect maybe they put him with me because I was so clueless coming in to the program, and because I\u0026rsquo;ve announced my intention to study for many weeks and a goal of getting proficient in Spanish. I think maybe they are trying to give me a leg up so that a week or so from now I\u0026rsquo;ll get another teacher who can take me to the next stage. The first three lessons have been the normal getting-up-to-speed stuff. Lots and lots of irregular, but common verbs. Dates, numbers, months. Bits of grammar, mostly when I doggedly ask why a los instead of a las, etc. My homework consists of memorizing irregular verbs. I did great the first day and not so great the second day. I\u0026rsquo;m going to a fiesta again tonight, so I guess I won\u0026rsquo;t do quite so well tomorrow either. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll surprise Esdras and have all the verbs memorized on Monday!\nWe get a 30 minute break at 10 or so, and I head across the street to see my nueva amiga, Rachel. She\u0026rsquo;s hanging out in San AndrÃ©s for a few weeks running the library in the morning for kids who go to school in the afternoon. They come in and play games, watch videos (when Rachel can sweet-talk an extension cord out of the policia next door), or have her read them books in Spanish. I speak English to Rachel to give my mind a rest, and to give her a break from los niÃ±os. Sometimes we play a game with the kids, sometimes just chat.\nSchool gets out at noon, and I make the hike back to my family\u0026rsquo;s house. Lubia has lunch ready, which is about the same kind of food and size as dinner. It\u0026rsquo;s usually stewed meat (super tender!), rice with carrots in it ( Â¡bonita!), and vegetables like salad or cucumbers. All the men of the family (the father, son, son in law, and grandson) drop in and out of the house during lunch. The women (daughter, daughter in law, grandchild) are around too (I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they have jobs, I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured that out yet). I eat with whoever is there when Lubia calls me to the table. They do not seem to make any attempt to have lunch as one big family.\nAfter lunch I laze around a bit, then do whatever is on the todo list for the afternoon. Sometimes the school puts on events, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s chores like going into Flores for banking and Internet, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s swimming in the lake, and increasingly the todo list includes a siesta, if I have time! I tend to shower in the afternoon, because the shower is cold water only, and by the afternoon a cold shower is exactly what you want. Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be memorizing verbs in there somewhere too.\nDinner is around 6 or 7, and is like lunch. Different parts of the family are around at different times for dinner. The family hangs around the house in the evening. I do too, unless the gringos in town have invited me out for something, like the fiesta in the next town over.\nThere are no classes on the weekend. This weekend I\u0026rsquo;m going on a trip to the southwest with a group of gringos in town that have rented a van and driver and needed more people. It sounds like it is going to be a blast, with a gringo-friendly hostel, water pools and a cave tour by candle light. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you all more about it next week. The next weekend is Easter weekend, which is a very big deal here. I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out what to do for that. Perhaps Rachel will have a good idea, and I can tag along with her. She\u0026rsquo;s heading south about then, so perhaps we\u0026rsquo;ll head south together then I\u0026rsquo;ll return to San AndrÃ©s while she continues on toward El Salvador.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a thousand other things I wanted to write about, but it is time to head home. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep a list of stuff to write about over the next few days and send out another big update next week. Have a good weekend, everyone!

At 5 am or so, the roosters start making noise, which in turn wakes up the pigs who make snuffling noises in the street. In some parts of town, diesel powered corn grinders start up to grind the corn for the morning torillas. One gringa friend of mine here has one next door, and cheerfully uses it as an alarm clock. There are happily none near me, so I can sleep in. (I think my mama gets her tortillas from a tortilleria down the road.)\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Life in San AndrÃ©s"},{"content":"Those of you who have been wondering, I made it to little San Andrés, Guatemala and am settled in with my family.

Well, now I\u0026rsquo;m about to start some new stuff, I figured I better flush out the queue!\nMy last update was from New Years. I spent January in Arnold. I occupied myself there by working on DTN2, the reference implementation of the emerging Disruption Tolerant Networking protocols. This work will be useful both for the Interplanetary Internet, and also for getting information to parts of the world where networks don\u0026rsquo;t reach reliably, like developing regions. For more information about how this (and other technology) can improve people\u0026rsquo;s lives in emerging regions, see the TIER website at Berkeley.\nI attended a workshop Berkeley put on and got to meet other people working on this stuff. Also, I got to go skiing for the first time ever at Lake Tahoe\u0026rsquo;s Squaw Valley. It was a really great day of skiing.\nAnother way I spent my time in the Gold Country was by taking classes from the Red Cross. When I am back to living in one place long enough, I will join a Disaster Action Team, which is the front-line unit in the \u0026ldquo;army\u0026rdquo; of the Red Cross. A DAT does day to day interventions, like showing up with blankets, money for hotels and teddy bears after a single family house fire. People from a city\u0026rsquo;s DAT are also usually first on the scene to open a shelter in case of a bigger disaster. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve had about 6 classes, and am well trained and ready to work. I just need to stay in one place long enough to join a DAT team. Perhaps that will happen this summer, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nOver a month ago, I set off on a road trip to Texas. Texas? Sure! Why not? It\u0026rsquo;s not like I have to be at work on Monday\u0026hellip;\nThe trip started with me swinging through the Bay Area. I played in the Iron Puzzler with Team Snout. I then stayed with Acorn for a week. My rent was to get his MIG welder up and running, by running around the city getting gas and parts to hook up the gas tank. Then I built a welding table for us to practice what Acorn and I were reading in the book we bought. I saved half the welding for Acorn so he could practice too. The table turned out great!\nNext came Curtis\u0026rsquo; bachelor party. Much fun was had by all, but we are sworn to secrecy. Sorry, it\u0026rsquo;s a guy thing. (But Curtis promised to not let matrimonial bliss throw a wet blanket on his enthusiasm for LAN parties!)\nI headed east, aiming for San Antonio. I went by way of Pasadena and had an informational interview with the nice people at Project Concern International. Didn\u0026rsquo;t quite find the right person, but it was interesting to see the inside of another relief agency and compare it to MSF.\nI got to San Antonio and met up with my mom, stepfather, and stepbrothers. We went to my cousin\u0026rsquo;s wedding and got a chance to explore San Antonio. What a neat downtown! The riverwalk is an amazing thing, especially because so much of it was built by the WPA during the depression. The Alamo was also interesting, though I left the place with ambivalence about a military commander so eager to sacrifice himself and his troops. Yes, \u0026ldquo;remember the Alamo\u0026rdquo; has a profound effect on Texas\u0026rsquo;s ability to raise troops and win its independence from Mexico. But it\u0026rsquo;s unclear to me that at the time Tyler chose to stand instead of retreat, he could predict the military significance of his sacrifice.\nFrom San Antonio I went north to Dallas to see Cliff and his band Escher\u0026rsquo;s Elevator play their first gig. It was fun to be \u0026ldquo;with the band\u0026rdquo;, though it was pretty hard work being Cliff\u0026rsquo;s roadie! Cliff\u0026rsquo;s improvisational electronic music was really neat. You can hear it for yourself on his website.\nNext Cliff and I headed south and I introduced him to Amy Lin, a friend I met in the Bay Area. After recently getting divorced, she\u0026rsquo;s now back in Houston working for NASA again. It\u0026rsquo;s a great change for her, because she had trouble finding a job that was a good fit. Now that she\u0026rsquo;s working on the human spaceflight program again, she\u0026rsquo;s really happy. A happy Amy makes for a happy Jeff!\nI next got a call from Cary at Tellme who wanted my help doing manual labor assembly work in Tellme\u0026rsquo;s new datacenter. I left my car/home in Houston and flew to Virginia where I worked for three weeks. It was pretty boring work, but the pay was good; good enough to pay for a trip to Guatemala!\nI returned to the Bay Area for final errands and to attend Curtis and DeeAnn\u0026rsquo;s wedding. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m postponing packing. I leave in a few hours for Guatemala, so you\u0026rsquo;ll hear from me from there next!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/03/13/wheres-jeff-been/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been having some more sedate adventures during the last couple months, so I\u0026rsquo;ve been remiss in telling y\u0026rsquo;all what I\u0026rsquo;ve been up to.

This is subtle, so hang in there with me\u0026hellip;\nIt, like other mail programs attempts to automatically maintain your address book for you by adding entries for addresses in mail you send. When you reply to someone who\u0026rsquo;s e-mail arrived without a real name, just an e-mail address you\u0026rsquo;ve got a problem: how do you add a useful address book entry for that?\nGmail adds an address book entry with the real name set to the part to the left of the @. A reasonable default, since some people\u0026rsquo;s usernames are close enough to their real names, and also because you might search the address book by typing some of what you remember from their email address.\nBut if you are a little bit obsessive like me, you prefer to see the address book have the proper real name. It makes the email look nicer when it goes out, and means that if you search on the person\u0026rsquo;s name instead of their email address, you can still find them. So I\u0026rsquo;m tempted from time to time to go in and fix up my address book.\nToday I noticed I was replying to someone who\u0026rsquo;s address book entry was missing the real name. I thought, \u0026ldquo;Oh jeeze, I need to fix that\u0026rdquo;. But for some reason, instead of actually going and editing things in the address book user interface, I just edited the To box to add in the real name, changing \u0026ldquo;To: foo@bar.com\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;To: Foo Bar foo@bar.com\u0026rdquo;. (Ok, so it helps that I\u0026rsquo;ve read RFC 822, and actually know the BNF for an e-mail address. I\u0026rsquo;m a geek. Sue me.)\nAfter making the edit, I realized, \u0026ldquo;Idiot. Now you just have to go do the same thing again in the address book.\u0026rdquo; So I sent the message and headed over to the address book. And found that Gmail had already fixed it for me.\nHow cool is that? It looks over your shoulder as you send things out, and fixes up your address book to track the edits you make to the To line. If this had been your run of the mill almost-good-enough-but-really-irritatingly-not-quite-right software, it would have noticed the address was different, and made a NEW entry in the address book for that, thereby leaving me with an address book that still needed pruning. But because this is Gmail, it Did Things Right.\nThank you, Google, for helping me make it day by day without throwing my computer off the top of the Empire State building.\nUpdate: I just noticed that they almost got it perfect: old e-mail from the same person does not get the benefit of the new address book entry. It is still missing the real name. It seems like during rendering of a thread into HTML, they should use lookups into the address book to \u0026ldquo;clean up\u0026rdquo; names in the headers. This simple request is likely fraught with performance problems and other subtle gotchas, so I suspect that it was considered and either skipped or delayed until all the gotchas are figured out.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/01/07/gmail-continues-to-rock-my-world/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI just noticed a really cool feature of Gmail.

Thanks to those of you who put me up, and those others who asked, \u0026ldquo;Where are you?\u0026rdquo;\nSince I last sent out an update, I\u0026rsquo;ve returned to the US from Dakar, Senegal. I made my way home by a sequence of trips that, if the TSA had known about them, would have put me on the no-fly-list for life. I flew one way from Dakar to Lisbon, spent the night, then caught the second half of a round trip I bought back in October. I landed in New York and made a bus trip north to Boston, then spent several nice days there with Jennie Hango. It was cold outside, so we did traditional winter things like hang out and play video games, and make chicken soup from scratch. Jennie makes really good noodles, and she does it like an Italian grandmother, without a bowl; she just puts the eggs into the flour and goes for it with her fingers!\nFrom Boston, I flew via a one-way on jetBlue to San Francisco, where Karl Larson picked me up and took me back to his house (which I am part owner in). As we went to sleep that night, me on the futon on the floor of his room, he said, \u0026ldquo;Seems kind of weird making you sleep on the floor of a house you own.\u0026rdquo; True enough!\nThat trip home, as long as it sounded, wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad at all. Each step of the way, I had little breaks built in. Much better than some huge 72-hour ordeal!\nI had a great Christmas dinner with Bay Area friends the next night, then drove south to San Diego. I spent several weeks there with family. I watched my Uncle Moose retire from 30 years in the Navy, giving up command of ACU-5. The ceremony was really cool, and it\u0026rsquo;s always fun to go walk around those huge hovercraft!\nAround Dec 30, I started a trip northward. I spent the night at Joshua Tree National Park on my way to Pasadena, CA. In Pasadena, I stayed with Beth Miles, an old friend from Mudd. She took me to a really great New Years party, and then threw a cool post-Rose-parade-and-hangover breakfast party for some of the same crowd. I stayed an extra day to learn to TIG weld from her housemate, Dave. Thanks Dave!\nI drove north and landed at Karl\u0026rsquo;s house again. I saw friends at Tellme, and got caught up on little jobs. Tonight, I\u0026rsquo;m going to stay at Dan Lennon\u0026rsquo;s place up in Berkeley. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of nice having people virtually fight over having me stay over at their place\u0026hellip; I suspect this is an early phase they are going through and that I better not count on it lasting!\nFrom here, I plan to go to my grandparent\u0026rsquo;s place in the mountains in Arnold, CA.

I\u0026rsquo;ll also be continuing to research jobs in the humanitarian relief \u0026ldquo;industry\u0026rdquo; and develop contacts with some technology-oriented development projects.\nI\u0026rsquo;d love to have visitors, but because of a bunch of cool things people have invited me to, many of the weekends in January and beyond are pretty much completely used up. However, I\u0026rsquo;ll be there during the week, and that is the best time to ski to avoid the crowds. So, if you are interested in coming to Westerly for a visit during the week in January, please contact me!\nThe first bit of February will be taken up by a road trip to a cousin\u0026rsquo;s wedding in San Antonio, TX. I\u0026rsquo;ll meet up with my parents, who are doing a road trip of their own through the Southwest. I don\u0026rsquo;t yet have a clue where I\u0026rsquo;ll visit, and when I\u0026rsquo;ll be back. If anyone has any suggestions, I\u0026rsquo;m all ears.\nMy self-imposed deadline for getting out of Arnold and having another big-A Adventure is March 13, the day after Curtis and Deeann get married. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a clue what adventure will be awaiting me by then, since part of the next few weeks is all about making that next adventure happen. The most likely adventure is two months in Guatemala learning Spanish. But I\u0026rsquo;m open to other adventures, so if you have an idea, send it my way.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also keeping my eye open for a way I can help with the rebuilding from the tsunamis. It turns out that relief agencies do not take new volunteers in times of crisis, because they need to be doing their mission, not training new people. This is probably as it should be, but it poses a problem for me, since I was just getting ready to start applying when the tsunamis struck. I\u0026rsquo;ll continue to watch and see if I can find a way to get the experience I\u0026rsquo;m looking for and be helpful. If it makes sense for me to be working in Asia instead of Latin America, ok, cool. My Senegalese friends would have thrown in a couple insh\u0026rsquo;Allah\u0026rsquo;s into that paragraph, and for good reason; no one\u0026rsquo;s plans are really safe from the twists of fate.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2005/01/05/a-new-years-update/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello, all my travel-watchers!

I made my way home by a sequence of trips that, if the TSA had known about them, would have put me on the no-fly-list for life. I flew one way from Dakar to Lisbon, spent the night, then caught the second half of a round trip I bought back in October. I landed in New York and made a bus trip north to Boston, then spent several nice days there with \u003ca href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~jhango/\"\u003eJennie Hango\u003c/a\u003e.

I would have thought that would drive me crazy, but you get used to it. And the Senegalese sense of humor makes it fun, since a huge part of the bargaining process is making the other guy laugh. If you are at a place where negotiations seem to be at an impasse and you add in some Wollof sprinkled with even more broken French, they crack up into gales of laughter, and give in on the price. Once a guy told me that he could not possibly go any lower because the money was for his mother. I countered, \u0026ldquo;But this is a Christmas gift for MY mother, and I cannot go any higher!\u0026rdquo; (Sorry Mom, it was actually something for me!)\nWhat really drives me crazy about this place is that NO ONE ever has change. It is really frustrating for the whole bargain to fall apart at the last minute because they can not make change. I have had a lot of time to consider this problem while waiting for people to run around trying to get change for my bills. It is not only a problem of me being a rich American with crisp big bills from the ATM. Even for small purchases, when I show up with a perfectly reasonable bill (for instance, a 500 CFA note for a 200 CFA purchase) the problem happens. It seems to be because there are too many sellers and too few buyers. The sellers probably only consumate a few transactions per day, and as a result they do not have a big bank to draw on to make change.\nSenegalese food is really good. We have not yet found something we do not like. The fish is cooked with spices to make the meat tasty all the way through. Meat (beef, squid, and chicken) is served with a really tasty onion sauce. Bissop juice is one of our favorite drinks. It is a tea of hibiscus blossoms chilled and sweetened with sugar. Even the lowly tea made by men to pass the time is great. It is super strong, with a touch of mint. It is served in tiny glasses with a carefully crafted mousse on top. I learned how to make it from our friends here, and I plan to make it at home for friends and family.\nWe have taken to the local custom of eating with spoons from a shared plate. The other day we made an American-style potato and egg breakfast. Instead of having to do dishes for four people, we all readily agreed to eat right out of the pan as though it were a Senegalese serving platter. We did not, however sit on the floor of the boat, and as there is toilet paper in Wonderland\u0026rsquo;s head, we let the lefties use their left hands to eat.

We made it to Senegal!\nThis passage was much easier than the last one. It was over 850 miles, so we were prepared for it to take over a week to get here. That\u0026rsquo;s a long time on a little boat!\nThe weather was pretty much in our favor all the time. That meant almost the entire way the wind was behind us, or on our port beam (perpendicular to the boat on the left side). When the wind is exactly behind you, you can put the main on one side and the jib on the other in a configuration called wing-on-wing. It\u0026rsquo;s really beautiful to behold! And it makes the boat go fast, so we got here in just 7 days!\nI had morning watch this time, which was from 0600 to 1000. Getting up was easy because someone was there to wake me up. Then the rest of the watch went fast as I fished, watched sunrise, reconfigured the boat for daylight, and then got Evi up to do our radio conversations (at 8 and 9). It was a great way to start the day; I will happily do morning watch again.\nOne day I had a great watch. It started out with night time dolphins. They made streaks of phosphorescence. You could not see the dolphins at all, just the comet-like streaks moving around the boat. Cool! Then at dawn, I caught a fish. I put the line back in the water because it was tangled up and in my way in the cockpit. I got another fish immediately, so now I had two fish flopping around not quite dead, and another tangle of line. I figured, well three would not be TOO much, and put the line in again. I went below to find the rum we use to kill the fish (pour it in their gills), but got another fish when I was below decks. This time I did not put the line back out! Evi came up from bed and helped me gut, fillet, and skin them. We had them for lunch and dinner for three days!\nFor the record, the fish were all tuna, about 16 inches long. They yielded over 3 pounds of fillets!\nOne evening as we were getting ready for bed, we hit a whale. It was this big hard bonk, then the boat kept going. It was pretty scary for a second, until we were certain that the boat was not taking on water, and that the whale would not try to take revenge. Other than floating containers (like the kind you see on trailers on the highway) whales are about the only other thing in tropical waters that can hole a fiberglass boat like Wonderland.\nDuring the first few weeks aboard (over a month ago!) I read the books Evi has on board about sailing, sailboat maintenance, cruising, etc. One of the things from those books that stuck out in my mind was this sentence: \u0026ldquo;Baking perfectly matches the pace of life on a boat. When you run out of bread from land, try making some yourself!\u0026rdquo; After a few days at sea, I was sitting on morning watch thinking that the regular breakfast (granola, yogurt, milk, and the first of many bottles of water) was getting old. I decided that I wanted to bake scones for the crew so that they\u0026rsquo;d be ready when everyone got up. I went below and took a look in the Moosewood cookbook, but there was no scone recipe! How could that be? So when people woke up, I asked if there was another cookbook on board, but there were not any with scone recipes. So we asked on the radio, and got a recipe, but it used some magical English flour called self-rising, so we had to experiment with the recipe some to figure out how to simulate self-rising flour with our boring European flour and three-year old American baking powder. The first try was OK, but on the second day the skipper said they were Out Of This World! (The secret, it turns out, is to use the broiler to brown the tops. The high sugar content in the dough makes the tops brown in a really satisfying way.)\nI also made bread the next day. It turned out great and I got a request for a repeat performance for Thanksgiving.\nWe had a great Thanksgiving while underway. We got email from both my Mom (thanks mom!) and from the Pratt family. We had been making plans and setting aside produce for several days before. We were hoping to catch another fish for Thanksgiving, but had a vegetarian menu planned too, just in case. We didn\u0026rsquo;t catch a fish after all, so we had mashed potatos, baked sweet potatos, carrots and broccoli steamed and buttered, garlic sesame green beans, and homemade bread.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/11/26/made-it-to-senegal/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHi everyone!

I\u0026rsquo;d been looking at the crepe page in the Moosewood cookbook for ideas for dinner crepes ever since I made them for breakfast a few days ago. They were a hit for breakfast, so I figured dinner was the logical next step!\nMoosewood suggested a spinach and ricotta filling. That sounded ok, but a little bit boring. I was also a little worried about finding ricotta here. Spanish supermercados are a little funny about cheese. There are often 15 variations on manchego, but no other kinds. Want parmesian, ricotta, or brie? Too bad!\nSo I had a backup plan: steamed cauliflower with ginger orange sauce. Of course finding fresh ginger in Spanish markets is about as hard as finding ricotta, but the girls managed to snag some a while ago and have been using it to make fresh chai. It\u0026rsquo;s starting to go soft, so I was looking forward to helping get rid of it.\nAs usually happens with my plans, everything went to hell when it came time to implement them. I like having a plan so that I can tell when I\u0026rsquo;m no longer following it! The problem was that my day to cook was a Sunday, and I was too tired Saturday night to remember to shop. (Saturday, we got up at 0430 to sail from La Palma de Gran Canarie to Santa Cruz de Tenerife.)\nSo I went out shopping this morning, but struck out. So dinner was going to need to come from stocks on board. I decided to stick with the spinach, but instead of wilting fresh spinach (normally the only cooked spinach I can stomach) I\u0026rsquo;d use canned. I knew at least Hannah likes canned spinach because I noticed that she put it in the shopping cart. I made a crepe filling by sauteeing onions in olive oil. I added lots of pepper and cumin (another Hannah favorite) to the onions. I dumped in a drained can of sliced mushrooms and the canned spinach (also drained). Even with draining, the pot had a lot of liquid which I imagined would destroy my crepes (which by this point were rolling off the line into a somewhat balky but warm oven). So I cooked the hell out of the spinach filling with the top off to boil off the liquid.\nThe spinach, in retribution for me putting the heat to it stunk its usual stink. I grimmaced and decided if I was going to get anything to eat tonight I was going to have to make another filling. So I started thinking about the leftovers on hand. We had some chicken I could have used somehow, and a very few cooked potatos. I started thinking about the rosemary chicken and potato pizza at California Pizza Kitchen, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have any rosemary. Then I got a bolt of inspiration: dosas are Indian crepes, and my favorite dosa filling is curried potatos. Now I was excited about making curried potatos for my crepes, but I wanted to make more than the single serving of leftover potatos we had. I looked at the crepe batter: one half gone. The crepe production line was only going to be up and running for 15 more minutes. The evil stench of the boiling spinach spurred me to action; I\u0026rsquo;d be damned if I was going to sully my crepes with that filth. And I started becoming concerned not even people who like cooked spinach would either! The entire fate of dinner rested on the curried potatos!\nIn the movie adaptation of this story, this is where they will cue the chase scene music as our hero (played by Denzel Washington, undoubtedly) swings into action\u0026hellip;\nSo I put the potatos (3 of them, sliced into 1/16th inch thick half-moons) into a frying pan and just cover them with water. I turn up the burner to NASA hot (thank you, Alton Brown) and parboil them until they are a little over halfway done. All the time, my left hand is turning out crepes, like sands through the hourglass. Will the potatos cook in time? Will Our Hero save dinner?\nWhen the potatos were done enough, I tossed the water and set the steaming spuds aside. I put 2 tablespoons of oil into the pan, then added 2 tablespoons of curry paste and browned it a minute. Then I dumped in a thing of yogurt and stirred it in. I added the potatos and a bit of water and simmered them. I played stupid games with the top on and off again as I wavered between freaking out that they weren\u0026rsquo;t cooking fast enough (lid on!) and that they\u0026rsquo;d be too runny (lid off!).\nLike the ending of a Hollywood blockbuster, the curried potatos got done when the last crepe did, which was just a few minutes before the guest from the next boat over showed up. We sat down for dinner, and everyone enjoyed both fillings. I have to admit, the spinach filling was pretty good.\nBut the curried potatos were excellent!\nRoll credits as Our Hero washes dishes.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/11/16/crepes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt was my night to cook dinner tonight.

If that\u0026rsquo;s all we have to do, then who\u0026rsquo;s steering? The answer is the autopilot!\nWonderland has two autopilots on board. The first one is an electronic one. The other one is analog and operates off of the power of the wind and the boat going through the water. They are both pretty interesting, so I\u0026rsquo;ll explain them both.\nThe electronic one is tied into the rest of the electronic instruments via an onboard network called SeaTalk. It gets the current heading from an electronic compass (which lies a lot) and it can also find out the direction of the wind from the mast-top windvane. Finally, it has a sensor of the steering mechanism to know where the rudder is. It uses all that data, plus the course you tell it you want to either steer to the course, or keep a constant angle to the wind. If our GPS was on SeaTalk, it would be able to send the bearing to the next waypoint into the autopilot too. I said the electronic compass lies, but luckily it lies in a manner consistent enough that we can ignore the absolue reading it gives, and just let the autopilot use the changes in the compass reading to steer the boat. The thing about the electronic autopilot is that it takes a lot of electrical current to run it. It\u0026rsquo;s not the electronics that take so much, it\u0026rsquo;s the mechanical steering arm that turns electricity into the force necessary to move the rudder. When it is steering, you can go below and look at the power consumption and literally see spikes when it steers left then right over and over to counteract the waves. Power use is important because sailboats are engineered to have small engines, small diesel tanks, and small electrical systems. The windmill and the solar can provide enough power for basic needs, but if you were going to use the electric autopilot 24 hours a day, you\u0026rsquo;d need to charge the batteries with the diesel engine a lot. When you are at sea for over a week (and there\u0026rsquo;s always a chance that one week will turn to two or more if various things outside your control go wrong) conserving fuel is important. And there\u0026rsquo;s always a chance the engine will fail.\nIn fact in Las Palmas de Gran Canarie, we met a boat named Chant Pagan which had it\u0026rsquo;s engine fail on the passage. They had only an electric autopilot, so in order to save battery for things like sailing instruments and the radio, they had to steer by hand. There were only three crew on hand experienced enough to steer, so they had a very long passage, each steering on average 8 hours a day. Luckily for them the weather cooperated - almost too well, as they had 25 knots of wind from the NE and tall following seas. Steering in those conditions takes a lot of concentration! Poor Chant Pagan.\nSafety comes from redundancy, which is part of why Evi has the other autopilot on board. It is a Rube Goldberg contraption that hangs off the back of the boat. For the first several hours I watched it I swore it couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly work. When reality proved me wrong and I looked a little closer at it (after 2 days of puzzling) now I see how it works. The idea is pretty simple. If you stood at the back of the boat holding a piece of cardboard up in the air edge on to the wind, but then the boat turned a little with respect to the wind (due to a wave, say) you\u0026rsquo;d feel a force exerted on one side or the other of the cardboard, right? And it might be possible to use some ropes and pullies to hook that piece of cardboard up to the steering wheel, right?\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s all there is to a windvane steering system. Or it would be, if the piece of cardboard was the size of a billboard, which would never do. The rudder requires quite a lot of force to do its job, so in turn the windvane (cardboard) would need a lot of force to turn the rudder. So what we need is an amplifier. My buddy Cary could whip one right up with a soldering iron and a trip to Fry\u0026rsquo;s, but then we are back to using too much power (sorry, Cary). What we want is an autopilot that uses no electricity. Where else can we get power on a sailboat? Well, it is a good bet there\u0026rsquo;s some wind when you want to be using the autopilot, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get enough power out of the wind. And it seems kind of silly to decorate the back of your sailboat with something sail-like to harness the wind you need to steer your boat. If only we could borrow some of the power coming from the mainsail and jib in some form we can use to amplify the control input from the windvane into control output on the shaft of the helm. Well there is, and it\u0026rsquo;s really clever.\nKnow how you put your hand out the window of a car, and you can use the wind passing over it to make it go up and down? You can do the same thing in the water flowing behind a moving boat!\nSo a windvane autopilot works like this: you\u0026rsquo;ve got a rudder-looking thing hanging off the back of the boat down in the water. It is attached by a Rube Goldberg set of ropes and pulleys to the helm by two ropes, a clockwise one and a counterclockwise one. This rudder thing does NOT steer the boat. It steals power out of the water in order to turn the helm. And the helm leads to the rudder via the usual cables. The rudder steers the boat. Above the autopilot\u0026rsquo;s rudder is the windvane. It is coupled to the rudder with yet another magical set of linkages that turn the input from the windvane flopping back and forth in the wind into instructions to the rudder to swing back and forth through the water, stealing power and steering the boat.\nThis is by far the coolest analog computer I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/11/16/autopilots/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI said before that on watch we only need to check for traffic and other changing conditions.

Plenty is going on, it\u0026rsquo;s just hard to squeze in time to go write an update at an internet cafe. So I\u0026rsquo;m trying a new system where I write updates offline when I get a chance, then upload them when I am online.\nMy last update was from Graciosa, a small island in the northeast of the Canaries. That\u0026rsquo;s where we made landfall after our passage. It was a great place to unwind from the passage-making lifestyle and get back into the cruising lifestyle.\nSpeaking of passagemaking, I owe you all an explanation of what it is all about.\nFirst, you need to appreciate the scale of the trip. It was about 500 nautical miles from Ayamonte to Graciosa, where we planned to make landfall. A nautical mile is a bit bigger than a statute mile, the kind we use on land. A nautical mile is based not on an arbitrary standard, but on one minute of latitude. Wonderland goes about 100 miles a day when making a passage, so you can see that we expected it to take about 5 days to make the passage. We sail 24 hours a day, so that means we average less than 5 knots per hour. That\u0026rsquo;s quite slow, so what gives? Why aren\u0026rsquo;t we averaging more like 7 knots? After all, we hit 7 knots in the Bay Area all the time, right? And the trade winds roar down the coast of Morocco here, so it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a question of wind.\nThe answer comes down to one thing that comes up over and over again in passagemaking: safety. When you are 200 miles from land, a helicopter can\u0026rsquo;t reach you. Ship-based rescuers are going to make 15 knots, if they are lucky; that\u0026rsquo;s about 20 hours when you figure in time to call for help and get it coming to you. You are on your own, more completely and absolutely than during any other activity most of us ever get a chance to do. So lots of aspects of passagemaking are determined by considerations of safety. From a sailing perspective, that means you are almost always flying less sail than you would in comparable on-shore conditions. Evi would have us watch carefully for speeds approaching 7 knots, then retune the boat to slow down. Her reasoning is that if we plan for an average speed less than 5 knots, why put extra stress on the equipment by doing 7? Good reasoning. It took a little getting used to for me to be able to understand and predict Evi\u0026rsquo;s decisions, but she was patient and answered my questions so that I knew the why and would be able to make good decisions on my own watches.\nAnother safety consideration is avoiding losing crew overboard. Man overboard is always an emergency, but it is vastly more dangerous when you are all alone on a big ocean. When I learned to sail in the Bay the rule we used was never leave the cockpit unless there\u0026rsquo;s a job to do that requires doing so. But then we\u0026rsquo;d go out and do it with just a life preserver on. When I started racing, I found that rule went out the window in order to adjust weight distribution for maximum speed. Racing skippers make other decisions that, strictly speaking, reduce the safety of the situation, but result in better speed (for instance, flying a spinakker in less than perfect conditions). Sailboat racing is simply a higher risk activity than pleasure sailing, and the crew knows it when they sign on. On Wonderland, the rules are much stricter about when to use a safety harness, have a buddy watch you, etc. It is exciting to work on the foredeck in rough conditions, especially when you know you can count on several layers of safety to protect you. Using the safety harness is actually so easy and convienent, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering why none of my skippers before Evi have insisted on it.\nWithin line of sight, boats use VHF radios to talk to each other, to marinas and safety crews on land. On the open ocean, however, you can go an entire day without seeing any other boat, so line of sight doesn\u0026rsquo;t do you much good. So, in addition to the VHF, Wonderland has a marine single sideband (SSB) radio, which can also transmit and receive in the ham radio bands. Evi has both a ship\u0026rsquo;s radio license and a ham license. There are loose knit groups of skippers who arrange to meet on a certain frequency at a certain time. The crew of the Wonderland is pretty bad about remembering these times, but when we do, we always get a warm welcome from Shadowfax and Tamoray. Even if there are no boats listening, there are always computers listening. We can use packet radio to send and receive email via the SSB and Evi\u0026rsquo;s laptop. We use it to fetch weather reports for our region, send in position reports, and send updates to our guardian angels telling them when to expect us. The speed on the connection is measured in characters per minute, so you can imagine how careful we have to be when we use it.\nI said before that we sail 24 hours a day. That means that during the night we either all go to sleep and just hope nothing goes wrong, or we have to use a watch system to make sure that someone is on watch all throught the night. A few boats don\u0026rsquo;t do watches, but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty rare. Of course Evi requires us to do watches! Because there are four of us, it\u0026rsquo;s not so bad. The 24 hours is broken up into 12 hours of daylight when everyone is awake and we share the duty of keeping watch informally and 12 hours of dark when we do watches. During the dark 12 hours, we do three hour watches. The cushy spots are 2100 to 0000 and 0600 to 0900, because you get to sleep through the night. The not so cushy ones are 0000 to 0300 and 0300 to 0600 (the majorly UN-cushy one). Because Hannah and I were the relatively less experienced crew, we got the easiest watches. Hannah is more of a morning person, so she took the 6 am one.\nDuring your watch you have to scan the horizon every 15 minutes looking for traffic. You\u0026rsquo;re also looking to make sure that the wind direction, speed, and sail setup all still make sense with respect to where you are trying to go. For minor corrections, or with certain rules (if wind falls below 6 knots, start the engine) we could simply take care of it ourselves. For anything else, Evi had us wake her up. That included cargo ships passing too near to us, major wind shifts, any equipment breaking or not acting like you expected. Finally, at the end of each watch, we\u0026rsquo;d chart our position and update the log with wind measurements, position, sail setup, etc. After your watch, you go below and get in the bunk of the person who\u0026rsquo;s replacing you. When we are at port, we have assigned bunks, but not out at sea.\nWe eat really well on the boat all the time, but it is slightly more challenging to cook when underway. Because the girls get seasick unless they are careful to keep up on deck, Evi and I changed around days with them to do most of the cooking out at sea. We cooked simple hearty meals that could be served in a bowl. For instance, the girls talked me through a seat-of-the-pants recipe for a lentil, potato, and sweet pepper stew. They also talked Evi through cooking vegetables in green thai curry. The nice thing about that kind of cooking is that it is easy to make extra food and have leftovers available for snacking. The funny thing about seasickness is that it comes and goes, so if you can eat the leftovers of the meal you didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like touching last night the next day, you should!\nEvi and I are lucky to get much less seasick than Hannah and Susha. However, the girls are both experienced at passagemaking and know how to keep the symptoms at bay. They were never completely nonfunctional, though during the worst of the storm, Susha was pretty much camped out in the cockpit curled up and sipping soup. Apparently, they don\u0026rsquo;t have too much trouble laying down in the dark, so when it came to be time to sleep, they\u0026rsquo;d go below. Nonetheless, with the boat banging around, sleep could be hard to come by. For a passage longer than a few days, you build up a sizeable sleep deficit, which may well contribute to stories you hear about disasters at sea. Evi asked us from time to time how we were sleeping to keep an eye on it. I luckily slept pretty well all the time, even when the boat was really crashing into the waves.\nDuring the first day, I felt during a few hours like I had a choice between continuing to feel seasick, not eating, and spiraling down, or getting better. All I had to do was take very careful care of my symptoms during that time (find some food to eat that didn\u0026rsquo;t sound gross to me, drink lots of water, stay above decks) and then I kind of broke through and never felt any symptoms after that. I suspected that my body would probably work like that, so I chose not to take the medicine Evi has on board. I figured the medicine would just interfere with the natural adjustment process. How lucky I am that my body is so adaptable!\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/11/11/passagemaking/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou may have noticed I\u0026rsquo;m not sending out many updates.

We are now in the Canaries on an island named Graciosa. It is very rural, with no paved roads. All the cars here are Land Rovers and models of Toyotas meant for use in Africa! It\u0026rsquo;s pretty neat to be in a place so different in architecture from Europe. The culture here is still very European, which I guess is good, because it makes the culture shock less. As we head south toward Cape Verde, things will get increasingly less European.\nThe girls (Susha and Hannah) have decided that we should go to West Africa, specifically to the coast of Senegal. After all, we\u0026rsquo;re in the neighborhood, right? Evi and I think this is a fine idea, but it is a bit of a pain in the neck trying to get the right shots for Senegal when you are traveling. We tried in Spain, but struck out: a very nice doctor lady was at the clinic in the next town over, and had the vaccines, but her nurse was on vacation, and the doctor was not allowed to administer the shots without the nurse. Because of my trip to Romania a while ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve got most of what I need already. Poor Evi has to get FOUR shots: yellow fever, typhoid, tetnous, and something else I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten already. It was funny watching the doctor pantomime where Evi had to get all the shots. It was like watching the maccarena!\nSo, we\u0026rsquo;ll try again here in the Canaries to get shots. Other more fun things coming up in the Canaries might include a camel ride up a volcano, and a visit to a banana plantation owned by a guy Susha met someplace in Spain. Susha is a girl with a guy in every port. When we got within range of the island, the phone started buzzing with SMS pages from all her buddies!\nIt is my night to cook dinner, and I need to shop still, so I\u0026rsquo;ve got to cut this short before I get into the story of the ocean passage. To whet your appetite, I\u0026rsquo;ll just tell you that it took two days longer than we expected (7 days at sea instead of a best case scenario of 5) because we had to weather a storm with sustained winds of 25-30 knots for 36 hours. I also was at the helm for our only squall, which packed winds of 30 knots, with a peak of 41 knots. For the non-sailors out there, 12 to 18 knots is a nice breeze to take a boat out in. In the US, 25 knots triggers \u0026ldquo;small craft advisories\u0026rdquo;. 30 knots is the official minimum for a storm to be \u0026ldquo;gale\u0026rdquo;. 60 to 80 are well into the hurricane range.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/11/03/in-the-canaries/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, I survived my first open ocean passage!

The trip to there, then on to Lisbon was uneventful. Lisbon airport was small and efficient, so getting through the airport, then into the town center was also uneventful.\nPortuguese sounds nothing at all like \u0026ldquo;Spanish with a French accent\u0026rdquo; as someone suggested to me. In fact, I never understood a single bit of Portuguese spoken to me the whole time I was there, it seems. It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to read, as it is a Romance language, and at this point my brain pretty much translates written Romance languages on the fly into English (that survival skill comes from all my time not speaking French in French speaking places). So I wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly incommunicado, but close. The people are nice, and enough speak English to get by, but it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly smooth sailing.\nAlso, it seems as though accurate information about the transit system in Portugal is hard to come by. I got a bunch of conflicting stories about where the busses are, which station has the train to Faro, etc. I basically fell back onto the trick of asking someone, then proceeding generally where they said and asking again. By asking 3 or more times along your route for the same thing, you can take the average of the answers and be relatively certain you\u0026rsquo;re headed the right direction. I always got the feeling people were trying to be helpful, but the information was simply complicated, and depended a lot on the season, the time of day, the phase of the moon, etc. I suppose it would be like trying to explain to a visitor to the Bay Area why it is cheaper and faster to use the bus to get to the airport from my house than to use the train and BART.\nOne other thing I noticed is that the magic of Europe has almost completely worn off on me. I actually felt more excited to be \u0026ldquo;someplace new\u0026rdquo; in New York than in Lisbon! I kind of miss the feeling of everything being new and different I used to get when coming here. On the other hand, the confidence that you can step off the airplane in any of a hundred cities in the EU and be completely in control is nice to have too. I think being so comfortable with Europe is part of what\u0026rsquo;s spurring me to move on to places like Morocco and Guatemala during this year.\nOK, enough philospohy! On to the travel bits.\nFrom Lisbon\u0026rsquo;s town center, I got online and found no new news from Evi. So I figured I could either hang out in Lisbon, or head south. As Lisbon didn\u0026rsquo;t really offer any \u0026ldquo;must see\u0026rdquo; items (like the Louvre, or the Prado) I decided to move on and do Lisbon for real at the end of my trip. After I figured out the time and place for my bus to Faro, I walked through the downtown on my way to the bus station. It was a typical European shopping district, with the addition of street vendors selling chestnuts roasted over a coal fire. I think that\u0026rsquo;s a special fall treat.\nI narrowly avoided getting sent across town looking for the bus to Faro, but I realized at the last minute that the completely impossible to follow instructions I was getting from the \u0026ldquo;bus guy\u0026rdquo; were actually to the other train station, and that I was actually getting shanghai\u0026rsquo;ed by the railroad guy. I don\u0026rsquo;t think he was actually trying to steal me from the bus line, but it sure felt like it. When I got across that I just wanted this certain bus line, he shrugged and pointed generally over his shoulder as though he didn\u0026rsquo;t really know, but he thought maybe there was a bus station someplace out over that way. Turns out, there was a very busy and well-organized bus station right outside the train station that the subway had spit me out into. I\u0026rsquo;d like to note, in my defense, that the train station had NONE of the things you might expect in it to indicate it was for rail travel. For instance there were no visible tracks, just this guy in this booth who seemed intent on sending me across town away from the bus station. Karl warned me to avoid the train and take the bus, but it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to do so when the rail company won\u0026rsquo;t admit it even IS one.\nI bought my ticket for the 14:15 bus to Faro, and had an hour and a quarter to kill. I saw a bus to Faro loaded with passengers, and I thought it was funny that all those people wanted to sit on the bus for an hour. But I also saw a chance to dump my heavy pack, so I headed over to the bus. The driver happily loaded my stuff, then tried to herd me on board. He seemed to be in a terrible hurry. When I showed him that I was on the 14:15 bus, he said, \u0026ldquo;No, we go now!\u0026rdquo;. Turns out the ticket window and the bus driver were out of sync. Guess which one won? So onto the bus I went, without my lunch. Luckily, I\u0026rsquo;ve done this before, and one of the things I did when I was in the shopping district was get a couple apples, some cookies and a chocolate bar, so I was all set with a not-entirely-nutritous lunch.\nThe trip to Faro was uneventful. I napped a bit, which was nice, because I only napped a bit on the redeye from New York to Lisbon.\nIn Faro, I walked pretty much directly to the Youth Hostel, using the \u0026ldquo;keep asking until someone says you\u0026rsquo;ve gone too far\u0026rdquo; algorithm. I used a twist on it this time, since there was a festival on like a county fair (it even had tractors and veggie slicers!). There were policemen all over the place directing traffic around the fair, and the address I was looking for was Portuguese for \u0026ldquo;police station street\u0026rdquo;, so I just kept asking every police officer I saw where it was, and got much more accurate instructions than usual. Yay for Romance languages, and police officers in tourist areas who have been forced to practice their English. My undying gratitude goes out to Faro\u0026rsquo;s finest.\nThe hostel was comfortable, but it either allowed smoking in the rooms, or my roomates didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the rules, so I smelled a little bit smoky when I left. Oh well.\nThat evening I entertained myself at the fair, even trying some roasted chestnuts (yuck; like walnut flavored paste). I had a pizza for dinner, because it occurred to me I\u0026rsquo;d neither slept nor eaten very well recently. In my sleep-deprived, jet-lagged state, I was not really hungry or sleepy, just zombie-like, so I figured it was best to tackle the symptoms of zombitude one at a time.\nI\u0026rsquo;d wondered what stopping one day in New York would do to my jet lag; would it make it better or worse? I don\u0026rsquo;t know if New York contributed to this, but my jet lag this time has been really annoying. My body seems to have settled into a stable bifurcated pattern where I wake up at 2:30 and am wide awake, then fall asleep again at 5:00. This has happened three nights in a row now, and it\u0026rsquo;s really getting annoying. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to beat it tonight by staying up reading until 2:00, then going to sleep. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll sleep through the night, and then can move my schedule forward from there by getting up early. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nFrom Faro, I went to Tavira via bus. I had the address of a hostel that was 3 km north of the city. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the distance, but the place supposedly had a pool and only a few rooms, so it sounded fun. It was a sleepy, quiet Sunday morning in Tavira, and so it was impossible to get any useful tourist info, like how to get a cab. Eventually I just gave up and sat on a bench, waiting for something to happen. This is another skill I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to deal with problems traveling; when you are out of ideas, just sit down and see if the problem solves itself. I know it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like it can possibly work, but somehow it does!\nNow, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to believe me, but in about 15 minutes, a cab showed up, right in front of my bench. OK, so I chose the bench because it was in a place where a cab would likely be, but still, it was pretty cool. I waved him down, and he took me to the address. I ran in to see if they had a room and found out that the place was actually now a rental property, and that the nice British family that had rented it for the week had no extra rooms. So back to town. I just chose a random hotel and asked to see the room. Turns out I chose the \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s Go Europe\u0026rdquo; recommended hotel for 2002-2004! A perfect little room for only 18 euro! I took a walk out to the beach, made a couch out of a destroyed sand castle, burried my feet in warm sand, and read. A nice way to spend the afternoon.\nThe next day I had to wait around until 11 am for the Internet cafe to open. When I checked my mail I found that Evi and Susha had made it to Ayamonte, so I hopped on a bus and took the ferry over to Ayamonte, and met them. I spent the rest of the day getting settled into the boat. Susha made a great dinner that\u0026rsquo;s likely to become one of my favorites. It\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;5 p\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; and it is a hearty, creamy, pink sauce on top of penne. She told me what the 5 p\u0026rsquo;s were, but I already forgot.\nThe weather is bringing winds that are unfavorable, so we\u0026rsquo;ll stay in port a little longer here. I\u0026rsquo;ll add an update when we leave for Madeira or maybe the Canaries.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/10/19/through-portugal-to-spain/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen I last wrote, I was on my way to Newark airport.

The developer has his wife rent an apartment in the neighborhood, then outsources the hand-written address part to a sweatshop in Liberia, then they send them out, and voila: instant grassroots support.\nSo I decided to pay a visit to Judy Sullivan, the author of the letter. My main question, though I had to figure out a polite way to ask it, was: How much are they paying you to shill for them? Judy came to the door when I knocked, having just gotten off of work. She\u0026rsquo;s a very sweet lady about the age of my mom. I figured, hmm, either this is a very sweet shill for The Man, or maybe she\u0026rsquo;s actually a Concerned Citizen. (And not the loony kind of Concerned Citizen that accosted me in my driveway on behalf of the No on Q folks.) After talking to her a while, I became convinced that she was in fact not a shill for The Man. Just like the letter said, she\u0026rsquo;s a nurse at the local hospital, and the primary issue for her is affordable housing.\nI pointed out the problems in the arguments that the developers are using (and that Judy copied and pasted into her letter). That 50% of the park space is under water, that the $10 million of \u0026ldquo;improvements\u0026rdquo; to the water supply is simply the hookup fee that any developer out there would have to pay, and that there\u0026rsquo;s no way to \u0026ldquo;increase the water supply\u0026rdquo; out there on the edge of the bay. She didn\u0026rsquo;t have much to say about those points, but even as I was laying them out for her, I realized that though they show bad faith by the developer, they don\u0026rsquo;t invalidate her argument either.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;ve had my faith in local politics incrementally renewed.

I kept answering them hoping to finally get someone to talk to to get me on their do not call list.\nToday I got someone, and it turns out it was the friendly people at the Yes on Q campaign. I told her that (1) it was a cell phone, and she shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be calling it, and (2) that I\u0026rsquo;d like her to put me on the do not call list. Polite, simple, quick and painless.\nSo a few hours later I get another couple of hangups, and get really excited, because now I know that soon I\u0026rsquo;m going to get to nail their asses to the wall. Eventually I get a call where they manage to hook me up to a human, and stupidly mention the do not call list before I get all the info from her to let her know I\u0026rsquo;m going to be sending in a formal complaint. She hung up as soon as she heard \u0026ldquo;do n-\u0026rdquo;. I swear to god, no goodbye, nothing. Evil.\nBy the way, I went and reread the stuff at donotcall.gov and found out that political organizations that are looking for a handout are allowed to hassle you, even if you are on the national do not call registry. However, if you ask them to add you to a local do not call list, they must respect that, after the first call.\nUpdate: As I was writing this, I got ANOTHER CALL! These guys are INSANE. I managed to keep this guy on the line long enough to attempt to get the information I needed to file a complaint. This guys had two excuses. First, he said his company had just gotten the telemarketing job an hour ago, and that there was no chance that I\u0026rsquo;d already been called by his company. And second, he told me there was NO SUCH THING as a do not call list. He ended up hanging up on me while I was giving him my phone number for a message to his supervisor.\nUn-fucking-believeable.\nBecause the ditz the No-on-Q people sent to pester me at home was such an idiot, I had actually considered voting yes, just to spite her.

It fell over. What a jackass. One way to know for sure he\u0026rsquo;s a jackass is the theory about compression and RAID.\nFirst, Gmail doesn\u0026rsquo;t use RAID. It uses the Google Filesystem. It is like RAID, but implemented in user space, which lets Google play games with filesystem semantics you can\u0026rsquo;t do when you are restricted to one of the Unix filesystems on top of a hardware RAID box. It also leverages the CPU power you get for free when you buy thousands of PCI busses and IDE interfaces. The mainframe guys figured out long ago the key to throughput is lots of I/O paths. The Google Filesystem lets them use lots of CHEAP I/O paths, instead of the insanely expensive I/O paths that Netapp and Sun sell.\nAs an aside: It is hilarious to watch the other email providers use their giga-buck Netapp filers to try to compete with Google on email account size. What little profit they might have been making from ads is going to go right out the window when the ops team has to buy 20 new NetApps to meet the demand caused by marketing\u0026rsquo;s little stunt of trying to keep up with Google.\nSecond, the compression stuff is bogus. Disk is cheap. Buying, powering, and fixing the millions of CPUs it would take to do all that compression would dwarf the savings from the compression. Not to mention adding latency to the UI, which is something Google prides itself on avoiding.\nTo Google\u0026rsquo;s credit, this jackass only managed to make his account unusable. Oh, and the accounts of the few thousand other people who have parts of their mail spool files stored on the same disk servers as him (and even those people were relatively less effected, since it\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely they all depended on precisely the same set of disk servers that Kevin\u0026rsquo;s account is on). At least he didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to destroy the inbound mail servers. This is typically a case where you\u0026rsquo;d see cascading and amplifying failure. Typically, what you see in a test like that is an overloaded disk server, which would have caused the inbound mail server to queue, then fail. When that inbound mail server was taken out of service, another one would have fallen, and so on. So instead of only having one set of disk servers overloaded, you have that and zero remaining inbound capacity. Cascading and amplifying. Two words sysadmins don\u0026rsquo;t like very much.\nOf course, as of today, two other words Gmail sysadmins probably don\u0026rsquo;t like very much are \u0026ldquo;Kevin\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Rose\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/07/30/gmail-doesnt-use-raid/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis guy arranged for thousands of email messages to be sent to his Gmail account at once, and surprise, surprise!

There are fewer classic Moore scenes in it than his other movies, which is a huge improvement. His message is way too important to be lost in the noise of his wacky hijinks. In some ways, I think the criticism of his previous movies have taught him what Moore-moments are defensible, and which ones he needs to just leave out of movies. (The bank-rifle scene in Bowling for Columbine scene is a case where he was fairly excoriated by the critics, I think. To my knowledge, there are none of those in Fahrenheit 9/11.)\nOne thing I really liked about it was the pace. He does a very good job of balancing serious stuff that brings a tear to your eye and requires thought to absorb, and zany vintage-Moore scenes that make you laugh.\nHowever, one of the transitions was very uncomfortable; he cut from footage of Bush on the aircraft carrier declaring the end of major combat to footage of a mortar landing near some American troops. The shock of the mortar going off and the troops disappearing into smoke was like the punchline in a joke. But I immediately found myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;please God, let that just be a bang, not a deadly attack\u0026rdquo;. Alas, the troops were injured by the attack, and you see them being carried off in stretchers. It made me unhappy I\u0026rsquo;d perceived the boom as a punchline, and it made me mad at Moore for putting me in that situation.\nAlso, there\u0026rsquo;s been a bit of a kerfuffle over the graphic scenes in the movie. There are some, and they are appropriate to the message of the parts of the movie they are in. The MPAA made the right call on the R rating, I think. I understand Moore\u0026rsquo;s argument about the rating, but there was no compelling reason to bend the rules for this movie, and the rules clearly put the kind of images Moore chose to put into his movie into the \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; rating. Perhaps Moore\u0026rsquo;s argument about the rating was just a publicity stunt. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t put it past him.\nAll in all, this movie tells Moore\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint, and I\u0026rsquo;m all for that. One of the few things from the political world that has recently warmed my heart is that the right wing zealots have given up attacking this film on the grounds that Michael Moore shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be allowed to say these things. It could simply be for the pragmatic reason they are trying to keep from giving him press. But I prefer to believe it is because even the right wing understands that once we\u0026rsquo;ve lost the freedom of speech, we\u0026rsquo;re all in real trouble.\nExcept the Fox News Channel.

VNC protects me from that problem. Another example is Excel: I use it to help me visualize data because Microsoft has invested millions of dollars in making the UI fluid.

I\u0026rsquo;m copying it down here so that I don\u0026rsquo;t lose it.\nI was in Budapest in the fall of 2000 on my way to Oradea, Romania. There, I helped build a huge house to be used for a family-style orphanage. It had 8 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 1.5 kitchens, 2 living rooms, and a dining room. We had to finish it from a finished foundation and framed walls to \u0026ldquo;pillows and sheets on the beds\u0026rdquo; in about 8 days.\nAnyway, here\u0026rsquo;s some memories of Budapest:\nthe contrast of the inside of the airport (like Frankfurt, but smaller) and the decomposing Russian airplane we saw on the way off the airport grounds. seeing the Danube and thinking \u0026ldquo;hmm, it\u0026rsquo;s not blue. oh well, at least now I\u0026rsquo;ve seen another Great River (tm)\u0026rdquo; people watching in the indoor marketplace; the grannies are always the best taking a walk at dawn and watching the rising sun light up the parliament building having a pint at the Irish pub on the boat (is there ANYWHERE the Irish have not preceded me with kegs of Guinness? God, I hope not.) trying to buy a train ticket to a city spelled V-A-C by asking for \u0026ldquo;vack\u0026rdquo;, and getting corrected by a very confused and frustrated ticket seller once he understood I wanted to go to \u0026ldquo;vash\u0026rdquo;. a priest in Vac who told me he\u0026rsquo;d come to San Francisco long ago during the Communist years. a friendly cat up past the church on top of the hill in Vac We flew in and out of Budapest, since at the time their airport had much better connections to western Europe than Romania\u0026rsquo;s. We spent the night in Budapest, then took a 8 hour bus ride across Hungary to get to Oradea. We worked ourselves to death, but finished the house on time. We rode the bus back to Budapest and had one free day there. Most people used it for sightseeing, but I was so exhausted from the final sprint to finish the house that I knew my body couldn\u0026rsquo;t take a day of sightseeing. In order not to tempt myself, I took a train north to Vac, a little city an hour\u0026rsquo;s train ride north of Budapest. I passed the day there, reading and napping on the banks of the Danube.

The same reasoning would allow Republicans to move some votes from states like Texas to the battleground states.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started looking into where to move my vote. It looks like the Great Lakes states will be fiercely fought. So I\u0026rsquo;m currently investigating registering to vote absentee in Michigan, Ohio, or Pennsylvania.\nA great source of data about all the states\u0026rsquo; differing laws related to voter registration is Declare Yourself. From there I\u0026rsquo;ve so far found out that your first vote ever in Michigan must be in person, so that one is out. That leaves OH and PA.\nFor Ohio, residency is defined as \u0026ldquo;the place to which you intend to return when absent\u0026rdquo;. Also, if you\u0026rsquo;ve been absent from Ohio for 4 years, you cannot be a resident. So that\u0026rsquo;s going to be tricky to achieve.\nFor Pennsylvania, this page gives useful ideas. However, it is related to civil service, not voting. For my purposes, it has a nifty circular reference (being registered to vote is an indication of Pennsylvania residency). My best bet would seem to be to register a car there, though it\u0026rsquo;s unclear that would be enough for the registrar of voters.\nI also need to gather more information about how Electoral Votes are awarded. If it is county-by-county, I need to find a county which is hotly contested in a state which is itself hotly contested. If, on the other hand, electoral votes are awarded an entire state at a time, then I can register in any county. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in the past that the rules related to electors and how they cast their votes differ on a state-by-state basis, so I\u0026rsquo;ve got yet more homework to do.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/03/18/moving-my-vote/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI currently live in California.

Karl and I headed up around 7 pm on the train.\nWe ate at Cha Cha Cha, which was interesting fare for an Irish holiday (things got stranger later when the Swedish lead singer of an Irish band started playing Swedish folk songs). We went down the street to 12 Galaxies to hear Tempest.\nOne thing I\u0026rsquo;ve got to say about the band is that they really know how to do a finale. I was enjoying the show, clapping, shuffling my feet, etc. But I just hadn\u0026rsquo;t really felt like dancing much. Then came the finale. First, Leif called the audience to come up close. His command over us was powerful, we dutifully shuffled up closer. Then they went into the finale piece that ebbed and flooded, with peak after peak. When the end came, I was in an absolute frenzy, jumping and bouncing like a madman.\nThey came back for an encore, and I was grateful, if only to help drain the energy they left pent up in me from the finale. The encore was nice, but it lacked the same power over me. Just as well, since my head might have exploded otherwise.\nOne other thing I need to record for posterity is an emerging canonical ordering of instruments (ordered by decreasing coolness), as derived by Karl and I during the evening:\nBass played by a hot chick Electric mandolin Electric violin Bass Electric accordion with a wah-wah pedal Acoustic accordion Kazzoo French Horn Karl helped with the final ordering by pointing out ties could be broken by ranking the instrument you see less often as cooler.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2004/03/18/happy-st-patricks-day-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI had forgotten it was St. Patrick\u0026rsquo;s day until I checked my personal email and discovered mail from \u003ca href=\"http://www.tempestmusic.com/html/michael.html\"\u003eMichael Mullen\u003c/a\u003e giving last-minute notice of a Tempest show in the City.

I\u0026rsquo;m lazy when it comes to thinking things through to the absolute last detail, so if you write a book that I hear about, buy and read, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely earn me as a disciple. At least until you are proven to be an ass by other scientists. (My record so far is not bad; in high school it was fractals and chaos theory, a few years ago complexity theory, and now automata. None have proven to be completely without merit.)\nWolfram\u0026rsquo;s conviction that we need to think things through from a new perspective to make progress on hard problems is very compelling to me. I disapprove of how he tuned out from the scientific community to go make 20 years of progress on his own, but I can also understand why he decided to proceed that way. I think that 20 or 100 years from now, when the Principle of Computing Equivalence has been promoted to a law, Wolfram\u0026rsquo;s tome will be compared to Newton\u0026rsquo;s Principia.\nAs I was writing this, I searched for other references to The Matrix Reloaded and Stephen Wolfram, but didn\u0026rsquo;t find any.

If you aren\u0026rsquo;t a sysadmin, that will either not make any sense at all, or will give you some insight into what our lives are like.\nSo I figured it can\u0026rsquo;t be too hard, right? Getting this info from a SCSI disk turns out to be easy, as long as you have Veritas NetBackup server installed, and are on a Sparc. You run \u0026ldquo;sgscan\u0026rdquo;, which uses the SCSI Generic driver to scan the buses. Fine, but I was on Solaris x86, and though I did have the NetBackup client package available to me, sgscan is only available in the server install.\nAfter digging around some, I learned about the uscsi(7) man page. Interesting stuff there, and good unique terms to search on in Google. As a result, I found some code at MIT I could adapt to do the same thing sgscan was doing, but for free, and in source form, so I could compile it on Solaris x86. The resulting program is here.\nOf course, this is only for SCSI, not for IDE. I did it because I thought it would be nice to understand how sgscan does its work, and also because I was hoping that Solaris\u0026rsquo; unified handling of disk and tape devices might extend far enough to make IDE drives act like SCSI ones for the sake of inquiries. No such luck. When you run it on a raw device for an IDE drive, you get \u0026ldquo;inappropriate ioctl\u0026rdquo;.\nI knew that IDE drives get probed at boot just like SCSI ones do. I found this line in my logs, and then went and found the corresponding code in the Solaris source.\ngda: Disk0: \u0026lt;Vendor \u0026#39;Gen-ATA \u0026#39; Product \u0026#39;Maxtor 5T030H3 \u0026#39;\u0026gt; That convinced me that it was very likely the data I needed was there in the kernel, but the gda driver had not bothered to print it out. I toyed briefly with trying to compile the gda driver, but I know from past experience that the Solaris sources are pretty much read-only they way they ship them. Critical files are missing (hello, tcp.c, where are you?) and the Makefiles assume that you are sitting at Scott McNealy\u0026rsquo;s desk in Mountain View.\nSo I started digging, planning to use adb to ferret out the info. Let me tell you, digging backwards from the log message towards the probe was not a good idea. I wasted lots of time out in kernel hinterland, then finally realized that \u0026ldquo;Gen-ATA\u0026rdquo; is probably not coming from the disk (duh!), and could probably be found in the source, and would act as a useful signpost. From there it got much easier, since I could see that indeed the firmware revision gets copied out of the inquiry reply from the IDE disk and put into the fake SCSI inquiry structure. (This faking they do is part of what got me thinking uscsi(7) would be enough.)\nata_disk_fake_inquiry( ata_drv_t *ata_drvp) { struct ata_id *ata_idp = \u0026amp;ata_drvp-\u0026gt;ad_id; struct scsi_inquiry *inqp = \u0026amp;ata_drvp-\u0026gt;ad_inquiry; ADBG_TRACE((\u0026#34;ata_disk_fake_inquiry enteredn\u0026#34;)); if (ata_idp-\u0026gt;ai_config \u0026amp; ATA_ID_REM_DRV) /* ide removable bit */ inqp-\u0026gt;inq_rmb = 1; /* scsi removable bit */ (void) strncpy(inqp-\u0026gt;inq_vid, \u0026#34;Gen-ATA \u0026#34;, sizeof (inqp-\u0026gt;inq_vid)); inqp-\u0026gt;inq_dtype = DTYPE_DIRECT; inqp-\u0026gt;inq_qual = DPQ_POSSIBLE; (void) strncpy(inqp-\u0026gt;inq_pid, ata_idp-\u0026gt;ai_model, sizeof (inqp-\u0026gt;inq_pid)); (void) strncpy(inqp-\u0026gt;inq_revision, ata_idp-\u0026gt;ai_fw, sizeof (inqp-\u0026gt;inq_revision)); } Finally, I came up with the following bit of ADB magic which will print out all the info. (You paste in the first part up to 40c, it prints the rest.)\n# adb -k physmem 3f8b0 (*((***ata_state)+0t12))+0t20/20c (*((***ata_state)+0t12))+0t50/8c (*((***ata_state)+0t12))+0t58/40c (*((***ata_state)+0t76))+0t20/20c (*((***ata_state)+0t76))+0t50/8c (*((***ata_state)+0t76))+0t58/40c 0xe153761c: T3RJ9B7C 0xe153763a: TAH71DP0 0xe153763e: Maxtor 5T030H3 0xe153791c: V80KQ8WC 0xe153793a: ZAH814YO 0xe153793e: Maxtor 98196H8 That\u0026rsquo;s the serial number first, then the revision, then the model number of the disk. The second set of data is for the slave IDE device on the primary controller. I do not have a machine with multiple controllers to test with, but you\u0026rsquo;d be monkeying around with the part of the expressions nearest the ata_state to skip to the second controller. Good luck!\nThis is a read-only adb operation, so it is very safe. I did it on all of our machines while they were in service, and I still work for my employer. However, YMMV. Do not ever start up adb unless you either can tolerate a panic, or know why you are not going to make one.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2003/05/15/finding-ide-drive-firmware-version-from-solaris/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am working on a mysterious bug at work, and absent of any other promising theories, I decided to compare the firmware revision of all the hard drives involved to see if that correlated with the pattern of problems.

The eventual goal is to teach WinAmp to play from the same collection of files, so that I can have one copy of my mp3\u0026rsquo;s in the \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo; and still get access to them easily on each device.\nThe first step was to investigate the TiVo Developers info. There I found a tar.gz file with some stuff in it that implemented the funky XML messages TiVo needs to know what\u0026rsquo;s in the directory tree. I fetched it put it in a directory on my webserver.\nNext, I realized I needed a beacon that I could point my TiVo at using \u0026ldquo;Manually Add Server\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. So I put this script together, using the beacon message doc as guidance, and the helpful beacon captures at KahunaBurger. Here is my beacon program:\n#!/usr/bin/perl -w $| = 1; $host=`uname -n`; $hostid=`hostid`; $plat=`uname -a`; chomp $host; chomp $hostid; chomp $plat; print \u0026#34;TiVoConnect=1 Machine=$host Identity=hostid-$hostid Method=Connected Platform=$plat Services=TiVoMediaServer:80/http \u0026#34;; while (\u0026lt;STDIN\u0026gt;) { # ignore it } exit 0; I run it with a command like this: tcpserver -d -v `uname -n` 2190 ~/bin/tivo-beacon. You can find tcpserver at the ucspi-tcp page on djb\u0026rsquo;s site.\nNext, you need to arrange for URL\u0026rsquo;s like http://ip-addr/TiVoConnect?params... to turn into hits on the example.cgi script from the tarball. This turns out to be harder than necessary for two reasons. First, since TiVo only knows the IP address, not the hostname, it can\u0026rsquo;t fetch from a name-based virtual. Second, a bug in TiVo\u0026rsquo;s implementation of HTTP redirects makes the name change to lower case.\nTo get around the no-virtuals problem, I had to put a symlink in the root of the real webserver pointing at my home directory, where my virtuals run from. I have root, so it was no problem.\nNext, I renamed \u0026ldquo;example.cgi\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;index.cgi\u0026rdquo; and added a local .htaccess file that enabled CGI (\u0026ldquo;Options +ExecCGI\u0026rdquo;). Alas, that didn\u0026rsquo;t work because Apache issues a redirect from http://ip-addr/TiVoConnect?params... to http://ip-addr/TiVoConnect/?params.... Note the trailing slash. That is correct behavior when accessing a directory, and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem. But since TiVo uncapitalizes the contents of the Location header when it follows an HTTP redirect it ends up trying to fetch http://ip-addr/ticoconnect/?params. So, you have to make a symlink in lowercase too.\nYou also need to edit the first bit of example.cgi and tell it where your photos and/or MP3\u0026rsquo;s are.\nAfter doing all that (and remembering that your webserver has a firewall, and it needs a hole poked for port 2190), it all just magically works! OK, well not really. It\u0026rsquo;s working some, but things are seriously flaky at this point still. I\u0026rsquo;ve just noticed that they don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be following the discovery spec when they send via TCP, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to copy the thing they are doing and see if maybe things will get better.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2003/04/16/tivoconnect-hacking/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTonite I set out to make my Tivo use my remotely-hosted Linux webserver as my MP3 server.

What a pain in the ass. If I manage to go another 5 years until I do Java again, I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy.\nThe problem with Java is that the language provides the tiniest little basic units, and everything else you need you have to build. Or use other things that other people built for you (but first you have to learn about them and understand their quirks). That all makes sense from a theoretical viewpoint, but it is just much harder to use than a language like Perl which has very well developed, robust primitives whose quirks I already mastered years ago.\nI was thinking about an analogy in the shower this morning. Imagine you are standing in a meadow. To your left there is a shovel and a chisel. To your right are a bunch of bins, each with a neverending supply of various building supplies. You see doors, windows, hunks of tin, bolts, sinks, even a fireplace (with the fire already lit!).\nYou feel a drop or two of rain. You look up in the sky and see a huge thunderstorm on the horizon heading directly at your meadow. You need a shelter fast. Are you going to:\nuse the shovel to open a quary, cut stones, mix mortar, and build a cathedral use the building materials to quickly throw together a shed to keep the rain off That\u0026rsquo;s what programming in Java and Perl feel like to me. With Java, you can build vast, intricate, beautiful structures. There will be mighty foundations, delicate spires, graceful buttresses, not to mention exciting spiral staircases and mysterious passages. It takes time, hard work, imagination, and finesse. Usually, the result reflects the amount of work that went into it. With Perl, you can make something that solves your problem right quickly and easily. It won\u0026rsquo;t be vast, it certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be beautiful, but it will keep the rain off.\nProgrammers are the kind of people who love vast intricate systems. The best programmers I have ever known are often less interested in the full context of the system than in the beauty and elegance of their part. They like writing code. When there are existing parts available to them that are not quite right for the job and prevent them from writing code to do it right, they often make their own thing that they trust more.\nAt the Sagrada Fami­lia in Barcelona, I saw both kinds of construction in one place. The cathedral builders know that it will take a long time to finish. So they built a stonecutting shack out behind it. Gaudi also designed and built a school on the property with the Sagrada Familia for the children of the workers. It was built cheaply of simple materials.\nEven Gaudi knew that sometimes a humble shack is enough to solve the problem.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2003/04/03/the-cathedral-and-the-shed/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI spent yesterday reading, debugging, and then fixing a Java program.

Lots of engineering effort in, little success out. I had a Vonage phone line for a while, and the call quality (mostly due to latency) was terrible. I was using my Vonage endpoint under significantly less than ideal circumstances, so it might not have even been their fault. But I\u0026rsquo;ve seen VoIP stuff take up lots of time and deliver very little value at work too.\nThe problem for VoIP is that it is competing against the rock solid, \u0026ldquo;can hear a pin drop\u0026rdquo;, telephone network. The way the telephone network makes such reliable, low latency, quiet phone calls is that it uses a very inflexible but deterministic system called TDM, or Time Division Multiplexing. TDM is expensive, because it can be wasteful. VoIP strips huge amounts of seemingly antiquated TDM technology away, which seems like a breath of fresh air to Internet-oriented engineers who are asked to implement VoIP. But then it turns out it is really hard to implement reliable telephone service, and throwing away all the work Bell Labs did to make TDM work so well wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a bright idea.\nSo, TDMoIP (which really needs a sexier name\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;packet telco\u0026rdquo; maybe?) is basically an attempt to use existing, trusted techniques to pound the square (reliable) peg of TDM into the round (cheap) hole of packet networks.\nBy the way, another good example of reliable and deterministic technology that beats complex technology is orbit delivery systems. The cheapest way to get to orbit is still on expendable liquid and/or solid rockets, not via the Space Shuttle. And rockets are more reliable too, on a chassis-per-chassis basis. We\u0026rsquo;ve built five shuttles and lost two. We\u0026rsquo;ve built thousands and thousands of rockets, and lost significantly less than 40% of them (before their designed-in destruction, of course). Yes, I know this is not a fair comparison, but it\u0026rsquo;s an interesting datapoint to start a conversation with, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you say?\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2003/03/30/tdmoip/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a new technology to learn about\u0026hellip; \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20031124002713/http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20030326S0012\"\u003eTDMoIP\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoIP (Voice over IP) has been a big disaster.

So while you may not be able to count on me to stick with something new more than 6 or 9 months, you can count on me to stick with those things for which I sign up.\nWhich brings me to the point. I\u0026rsquo;m out of new things to try since I\u0026rsquo;ve lost interest in the last crop. Having new things to learn about and do stimulates my mind, and introduces me to people I would not have otherwise met. When I choose well (which is not really very often, it turns out) these people are the right age to be dates, in addition to interesting acquaintances.\nWhich brings me to the point, again. Really this time.\nI\u0026rsquo;m thinking about taking up one of these things:\ndrumming, perhaps with the hula studio near my house making a clock out of wood, like one I saw at the Musee d\u0026rsquo;Horlogerie et Emaillerie, in Geneva. Note to self: there is a modern vendor of wooden clocks! getting involved in a Sea Scout post here in Redwood City Now the relative merits of all these have been swirling around in my head. There\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;how much time, expense and dedication is this going to cost\u0026rdquo; axis. And there\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;finding dates\u0026rdquo; axis, otherwise known as the \u0026ldquo;hot chicks\u0026rdquo; axis.\nPicking up hot chicks at Sea Scouts will be problematic. Not for the reason you are probably thinking. Women of all ages are allowed to be involved in Explorer posts (or at least they were when I was a kid). It would just be awkward dating within that group, though not impossible. The odds of finding a suitable date there are very small, in any case.\nPicking up hot chicks in my garage while working on a wooden clock alone is also pretty unlikely. Though if I cut myself and have to go to the hospital, I might meet a cute Filipino nurse who\u0026rsquo;s looking for someone to take care of. That might be nice.\nThe hula babes have a definite lead here, but I\u0026rsquo;m just not really sure how you walk into a hula studio and ask to join the drum team. That needs quite a lot more research.\nOf course, all of these need more research on the \u0026ldquo;cost\u0026rdquo; axis. The \u0026ldquo;babes\u0026rdquo; axis is much more entertaining to speculate on, it would seem.\nHmm, re-reading this post makes me think it probably would qualify as one of the \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; ones I was just talking about.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2003/03/22/some-things-im-thinking-about-doing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have broad curiousity, which I\u0026rsquo;ve made the best of, given that it tends to limit my ability to focus on something for long periods of time.

I haven\u0026rsquo;t been extraordinately busy. I just haven\u0026rsquo;t had anything to say. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to break the trend by saying something about not saying anything.\nOne reason I haven\u0026rsquo;t had anything to say is that some of the things I have to say are not for public consumption. And though I have no readers of this blog that I know of, I know that this is a public space. One reason I decided to start this blog (apart from the simple need to understand this technology) is that I know that to be a good writer, you need to write. I value keeping a broad set of skills in good working order, so I want to be, among (many) other things, a very good writer.\nOf course, two rules of thumb to being a good writer are probably to avoid parenthetical remarks (like the \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; above, and (come to think of it) this one too), and to elide \u0026ldquo;very\u0026rdquo;. Samuel Clemens said that you should write \u0026ldquo;damn\u0026rdquo; every place you are considering writing \u0026ldquo;very\u0026rdquo;. Then your editor will remove the \u0026ldquo;damn\u0026rdquo; in each sentence replacing it with nothing, and your writing will be as it should have been to start with.\nAlas, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a damn editor.\nAnother reason I want to keep this blog is that I would like to have a journal I can look back at in the future. I have appreciated the value of keeping a journal since high school when Mrs. Doerner forced me to keep one for a semester. Alas, the habit wore off, almost immediately. Since then, I have started and aborted several journals, each lasting one or two entries. This is my most recent attempt, and this entry is a desperate attempt to keep the habit.\nSo, at the junction of those two points, lies the problem. I want to have a journal, but the journaling medium I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen is a blog. I want to have a journal, in part, to record private thoughts, but a blog won\u0026rsquo;t allow that. Simply adding a feature to mark some posts as private, or keeping them perpetually in \u0026ldquo;draft\u0026rdquo; status won\u0026rsquo;t work either, since I could not write freely knowing that one operator error, or one software bug might publicly publish my private thoughts. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m familiar enough with the problems of privacy and technology that I probably would only put the private thoughts onto paper.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;m stuck. What self-respecting blogger would stoop to writing a blog on paper? :)\nSeriously, it\u0026rsquo;s at once a solvable problem and an unsolvable problem. Working on a blog subtly changes your inner dialog, since there\u0026rsquo;s always a little voice suggesting, \u0026ldquo;hey, that might be a good blog entry\u0026rdquo;. But another little voice chimes in and says, \u0026ldquo;yeah, but only for a private blog, which you don\u0026rsquo;t have\u0026rdquo;. If several days go by where it seems most of your bloggable thoughts should be private, then you don\u0026rsquo;t post to the public blog, and start losing the hard-won habit of writing daily. And then you risk losing that inner dialog, which points out topics which are blog-worthy, which should be helping with the journaling habit.\nSo what are all these private thoughts, you ask? Well, if I told you, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be private, now would they? OK, in general, they are thoughts on the war, statements about my state of mind, and behavior of friends. Stuff Jan Woodcock used to call \u0026ldquo;Heavy, Deep and Real\u0026rdquo;. Stuff that is too complicated to explain in a few paragraphs, and that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be held responsible for.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2003/03/22/im-still-here/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI just haven\u0026rsquo;t posted in a while, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm, why?

It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of being flexible and understanding that there\u0026rsquo;s more than one way to gather together the right number of calories, protein, nutrients, fats, and flavors it takes to serve dinner.\nI value flexability and adaptability, and I\u0026rsquo;m coming to see that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of patience with people who are not willing to try something new or see something a different way. I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to try working on that, because the ultimate form of being flexible and adaptable yourself is to be able to respect others and deal with them.\nEven if they are Meat EatersTM.\n","permalink":"https://blog.nella.org/2003/03/15/meat-eaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNow, as \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070621170435/http://bitsy.sub-atomic.com/~karl/\"\u003eKarl\u003c/a\u003e reminds me all the time, I do eat meat.
