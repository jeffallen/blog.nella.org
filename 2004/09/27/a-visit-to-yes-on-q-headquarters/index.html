I talked to a nice guy there named Bill Ferguson. Here are the things we talked about:

him: Your phone number is public knowledge once you register to vote, and we&rsquo;re allowed to call you.
me: Yes, you are allowed to call me. ONCE. Then I&rsquo;m allowed to ask to be on your do not call list.
me: Your telemarketers are not respecting do not call lists, and treating callers unprofessionally when they ask to be removed
him: I don&rsquo;t know how the call centers feed that back that list to us.
me: Please figure it out, because I will file a formal complaint against your organization if it happens again.
me: This reflects very poorly on your organization, and makes me unsympathetic to your arguments. I&rsquo;m likely to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; now.
