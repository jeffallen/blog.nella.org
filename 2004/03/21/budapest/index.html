  <div class="post-content"><p>A friend is on her way to Budapest, and I wrote some of this to her. I&rsquo;m copying it down here so that I don&rsquo;t lose it.</p>
<p>I was in Budapest in the fall of 2000 on my way to Oradea, Romania. There, I helped build a huge house to be used for a <a href="http://www.caminulfelix.org/">family-style orphanage</a>. It had 8 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 1.5 kitchens, 2 living rooms, and a dining room. We had to finish it from a finished foundation and framed walls to &ldquo;pillows and sheets on the beds&rdquo; in about 8 days.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s some memories of Budapest:</p>
<ul>
<li>the contrast of the inside of the airport (like Frankfurt, but smaller) and the decomposing Russian airplane we saw on the way off the airport grounds.</li>
<li>seeing the Danube and thinking &ldquo;hmm, it&rsquo;s not blue. oh well, at least now I&rsquo;ve seen another Great River (tm)&rdquo;</li>
<li>people watching in the indoor marketplace; the grannies are always the best</li>
<li>taking a walk at dawn and watching the rising sun light up the parliament building</li>
<li>having a pint at the Irish pub on the boat (is there ANYWHERE the Irish have not preceded me with kegs of Guinness? God, I hope not.)</li>
<li>trying to buy a train ticket to a city spelled V-A-C by asking for &ldquo;vack&rdquo;, and getting corrected by a very confused and frustrated ticket seller once he understood I wanted to go to &ldquo;vash&rdquo;.</li>
<li>a priest in Vac who told me he&rsquo;d come to San Francisco long ago during the Communist years.</li>
<li>a friendly cat up past the church on top of the hill in Vac</li>
